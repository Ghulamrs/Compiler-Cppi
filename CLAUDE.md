# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Two languages, and they are not the same one

**`src/` is ISO C++14. The language `cxx1` compiles is C++11 — minus the list
in `docs/EXCLUSIONS.md`, and with no C++ standard library at all.** Keep the
two languages apart in every sentence you write about this project, because
almost every confusing question here comes from conflating them.

The consequence worth stating up front: **this compiler can never compile
itself**, and that is deliberate rather than a gap. A C++11 compiler cannot
read C++14 source. Self-hosting is not a milestone here and offering it as one
is a mistake — see "How correctness is established" for what replaces it.

**The subset is not a footnote, and "C++11" on its own was a claim this
compiler cannot support.** Some of that has since been answered — `dynamic_cast`
works on all three targets, conversion functions exist, and `include/` holds a
real library: `<string>`, `<vector>`, `<map>`, `<set>`, `<algorithm>`,
`<utility>`, the five C wrappers, and the stream family `<iostream>`,
`<ostream>`, `<istream>`, `<sstream>`, `<fstream>`, `<ios>`, `<cstdio>`. What
remains is still a subset, and a large one: the library is sized to what has
been asked of it rather than to the standard, `<memory>` and
`<initializer_list>` are not there, and `docs/EXCLUSIONS.md` runs to a hundred
entries. An ordinary conforming C++98 program may still not compile here, and a
reader who took the headline at its word would meet that with nowhere to look.
`docs/EXCLUSIONS.md` is the list — **101 refusal sites**, derived from
the source by `tools/exclusions` rather than written by hand, and
`tools/exclusions --check docs/EXCLUSIONS.md` reports every refusal the
document does not cite. This is the tree's own rule 5 — *a claim with no oracle
is not allowed to be believed* — applied to the first sentence of this file.

`-std=c++14 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic` in the `Makefile`. A Mac cannot
enforce C++14: Apple's libc++ hands you `std::string_view` in C++14 mode, so a
C++17-ism compiles clean here and is refused only when it reaches real g++.
Build on the Linux box before believing a clean Mac build. Same trap, same
answer as Compiler-C.

Trigraphs are still live in C++14, so write `'?\?'` and not `'??'` in any
diagnostic. A C++ compiler's messages are full of quoted punctuation, so this
will come up more here than it did in Compiler-S, where it cost an afternoon.

## Reading this tree

**There is an order that works, and nothing here said what it was.** This file
is written in the order things happened, which is the right shape for a record
and the wrong one for a first reading - its first sections after this one are
changelog entries. What follows is the path, and every item on it already
existed; what was missing was the list.

1. **`README.md`** - what cxx1 is, what it is not, and how to build it.
2. **Six sections of this file, in this order**, and no others yet: "Two
   languages, and they are not the same one", "Where this came from", "What
   makes C++ different from C to parse", "The ladder", "Decisions already
   taken", "How correctness is established". Then "Understandable means
   checkable", which is how a change to any of it is judged.
3. **The pipeline, by file**: `main.cpp` (five lines) → `Driver.h` and
   `Driver::compile` → `Lexer.h` → `Preprocessor.h` → **`parser/Parser.h`**,
   which at fourteen hundred lines is the front end's design document and says
   so nowhere else → `Ast.h` → `Type.h`, whose `class Target` is the machine →
   `Abi.h` and `backend/Backend.h` → `backend/Walker.h` → one code generator,
   `backend/X86_64Linux.h`.
4. **One case per rung**, whose headers are the best short prose in the tree:
   `class.cpp`, `inherit.cpp`, `multiple.cpp`, `thunk.cpp`, `tuple.cpp`,
   `cleanup.cpp`, `lambda.cpp`, and `refused.cpp` for what is said no to.
5. **The suites**: the header comments of `tests/run.sh`, `tests/emit.sh`,
   `tests/names.sh`, `tests/overload.sh`, then `tools/verify-three`, which is
   the three-box rule with a command behind it.
6. **`docs/`**: `EXCLUSIONS.md` for what this compiler does not accept — read
   it before writing a program for cxx1, since it is the difference between
   "C++11" and what is actually here — then `CONFORMANCE.md` for what compiles
   and should not, the newest `HANDOVER-*.md` for where a round stopped, and
   `DESIGN-REVIEW-2026-09-02.md` for what to change next and what not to.

**What this file is *for*, once that reading is done**, is the measurement
behind a line of code: why an ABI answer is what it is, what a bug looked like
before it was mended, which oracle was asked. Search it by its `## ` headings;
do not read it end to end.

## The parser is twelve files

`Parser.cpp` was 9,639 lines and 450 KB, which is one translation unit: every
build recompiled all of it, and every reader had to find their subject in it.
It is twelve files now, in `src/parser/` — `Parser.cpp` and eleven
`ParserXxx.cpp` beside it — still one class, declared as it always was in
`Parser.h`, which moved in with them. `src/parser/` is laid out the way `src/backend/` already
was: the directory owns its headers, reaches the shared ones as `../Type.h`,
and is included from outside by path, so `Driver.cpp` says
`#include "parser/Parser.h"`. Both builds glob it — `SRCS` in the Makefile and
the source list in `msvc/build.cmd`.

| file (in `src/parser/`) | holds |
| --- | --- |
| `Parser.cpp` | tokens, name lookup, the declaration tests, scopes and symbol tables |
| `ParserTemplate.cpp` | parameters, deduction, partial ordering, instantiation |
| `ParserType.cpp` | class, enum, the specifiers and the declarator |
| `ParserOverload.cpp` | conversions, ranking, overload resolution |
| `ParserClass.cpp` | constructors, destructors, vtables, thunks, implicit specials |
| `ParserExpr.cpp` | primaries, names, the named casts, `decltype`, references, postfix and unary |
| `ParserExprCall.cpp` | arguments, defaults, by-value copies, member calls and their access checks |
| `ParserExprLambda.cpp` | lambdas, closures, captures, the deduced return type |
| `ParserExprNew.cpp` | `new`, `delete`, `throw`, and class temporaries |
| `ParserInit.cpp` | initialisers, the constant folding they need, and the objects built before main |
| `ParserOperator.cpp` | one function per precedence level |
| `ParserStmt.cpp` | statements, the top level, `parse()` |

**`ParserExpr.cpp` was split a second time, 2026-09-01**, by the same method
and for the first of the same two reasons: at 3,446 lines it was the largest
file in the tree by nine hundred, and a reader looking for how a lambda is
built had a third of a compiler to walk. Three files came out of it - calls,
lambdas, and the expressions that make or destroy an object - and it keeps
1,674 lines, which is the primary expression, the casts and the two operator
levels below the ladder.

**The seams were free this time**, which is worth writing down because last
time they were not: `ParserExpr.cpp` had exactly one file-scope `static`, and
its only two callers sat thirty lines below it. `binOpSpelling` has external
linkage and is declared in the shared header already. So the cut could follow
the subjects rather than the linkage, and `src/ParserInternal.h` did not gain
an entry.

**Cut by whole function, comment block included.** A range that starts at a
signature leaves the paragraph above it behind, attached to nothing - so each
function's extent was taken from the first line of its leading comment to the
last line before the next one's. Checked afterwards by counting lines: every
line of the original file is present in exactly one of the four, and the only
additions are the three new headers and their includes.

**Nothing was rewritten.** The split was cut by line range out of the old file
and the units were reassembled from those ranges, so the diff is a move and
the three boxes proved it: 97 / 153 / 52 on the Mac, 97 / 153 on Linux, 94 on
Windows and the C corpus at 379/424 — every number identical to the commit
before.

**A basename may not repeat across `src/`, `src/parser/` and `src/backend/`.**
That is why the nine kept their `ParserXxx` names on moving into a directory
that would have let them drop the prefix — `src/parser/Type.cpp` beside
`src/Type.cpp` reads better and does not work. `obj/` mirrors `src/`, so make
is safe; `msvc/build.cmd` gives cl **one flat `/Fo` directory** for every
source in one command, and there the second `Type.cpp` overwrites the first
one's object. It would have been found on the Windows box rather than here.

Where the seams went was decided by the file-scope `static` helpers rather
than by taste. A `static` cannot be seen from another unit, so a cut that
separated one from its callers would have forced it into a shared header; the
cuts were moved instead until only three helpers had callers on both sides.
Those three — `alignTo`, `isLvalue`, `isNullConstant` — lost the keyword and
live in `Parser.cpp`, declared in `src/ParserInternal.h`. That header is the
whole cost of the split, and it is deliberately short: if a later change wants
to add a fourth entry, consider moving the function instead.

## Refusing by name reaches declarations now, not only expressions

`notYetSupported` is the list of keywords the lexer knows and this parser has
no rule for, and it existed so that the word is *named* instead of the error
landing on whatever follows it. It had one caller, in `primary()`, so it only
ever worked for a keyword written in an expression.

Every keyword that begins a **declaration** slipped past it. Asked about
`friend int peek(const Account &a);` in a class body, cxx1 said `expected a
type` and pointed at `friend` - the right token, and nothing about what is
wrong with it. The same for `mutable`, `explicit`, `using` and
`static_assert`; and `int operator+(const Vec &o);`, where the type reads fine
and it is the name that is a keyword, ended in `expectIdent` saying `expected
a name`.

Two more callers fixed all seven, at the two places the generic messages were
raised: the end of `unqualifiedSpecifiers`, which is where a member
declaration that begins with an unknown keyword arrives, and `expectIdent`,
which is where one that begins with a type but is *named* by a keyword
arrives. Both now answer `'friend' is not supported yet` and so on.

**None of this implemented any of them, and that is what changed later.**
`friend` was the example: not on the ladder and never was, wanting a friend
list on the class that `checkAccessible` consults as well as a declaration
path that puts the function outside the class it is written in. Both of those
now exist - see "`friend`, and why it landed beside the operators" - and the
description above is exactly what the implementation turned out to be.

**And then the list went on saying they were missing.** Eight of the keywords in
`pending[]` had been implemented by 2026-09-02 - `catch`, `friend`, `mutable`,
`namespace`, `operator`, `template`, `using`, `virtual` - so `int x = template;`
was answered "'template' is not supported yet", which is a claim about the
compiler where the truth was about the place. There are two lists now, and the
second answers "'template' is implemented, but it does not begin an expression"
at the same three doors.

**Which eight was measured, one keyword at a time, and the guess was wrong
twice.** A review had named seven, including `inline`, which is *not*
implemented; it missed `catch`, `mutable` and `using`, which are. The check is a
one-line program per keyword in a place the keyword belongs, and it is what to
run before moving a name between the two lists - a keyword in the wrong list is
a diagnostic that lies in one direction or the other.

## Rung 5 reopened: a real tuple, 2026-08-29

Asked whether this compiler supports tuples. There is no `std::tuple` and
there never will be here - `lib/` is the C headers and there is no C++
standard library at all - so the question worth answering was whether the
*language* can express one. A fixed-arity `Pair` already worked. The
recursive variadic shape the real one is built from did not, and finding out
why turned up **nine** things rather than the two it looked like.

```cpp
template <class... Ts> struct Tuple;
template <> struct Tuple<> { };
template <class T, class... Rest>
struct Tuple<T, Rest...> : Tuple<Rest...> {
    T head;
    Tuple<Rest...> *tail() { return this; }
};
```

**Three were template gaps.**

*A partial specialization that peels a pack.* `template <class... Ts> struct
L;` has one parameter and `L<T, R...>` gives it two, because a pack stands for
a list rather than a type - so checking written arguments against parameter
count rejected every recursive variadic class. What says where the pattern
stops is the closing angle. Matching is the other half: the arguments arrive
as *one* pack, so `choosePartial` flattens them and matches the fixed
arguments in front, with a trailing `R...` taking the rest - possibly nothing.

*A pack expanded into another template's argument list*, `Tuple<Rest...>`,
which was refused by name. It works where the members are known, because a
pack argument is read last and takes everything left, so an expansion splices
its members in where it stands. **It is still refused in a pattern**, where
the pack stands for itself and what would be spliced is the parameter - that
is deduction, and a different problem with the same syntax.

*A dependent base*, `: Tuple<Rest...>`. The base clause read a bare identifier
and looked it up as a typedef, which a template-id can never be. Reading the
base as a *type* reaches the code that already knows how to instantiate one,
and costs nothing inside a template because a pattern is never parsed.

**Three more were consequences of those, found only by running it.**

A partial specialization may have a **base clause**, so `bodyAt` points at `:`
as well as `{`. A variadic template is very often **declared and never
defined**, every definition being a specialization - so "nothing to
instantiate" has to be asked *after* a partial is chosen. And a partial's pack
has to be recorded in its `Specialization`, because the held member bodies are
replayed later from that record: left out, every level replayed with an empty
pack and `Tuple<char, long>::tail` was declared to return `Tuple<long> &`
while its body said `Tuple<> &`.

**Three were nothing to do with templates, and two of those were silent.**

`int &get() { return x; }` was reported as a *reference data member*. At the
point that check is made the `(` has not been read, so the type in hand is
still the return type - the same shape as the `constexpr` function test in
7.5a, and the same fix.

**The empty base optimisation was missing.** An empty class has `sizeof` 1 -
so two objects of it differ in address - and a *data size* of 0, and the two
are different numbers on purpose. `dataSize()` answered 1, so `struct D : E {
int x; };` was 8 bytes where clang and cl both say 4, and **every class with
an empty base had a layout that agreed with no other compiler**. All three
users of `dataSize()` are asking "how far into an object does this base's data
reach", and 0 is the right answer to that for all of them. A recursive
variadic class feels it hardest: it bottoms out in an empty specialization and
pays at every level.

**A derived member did not hide a base's.** A base's members are copied into
the derived class's list at their own offsets - that flattening *is* the
layout - so the list runs most-base to most-derived and `findMember` has to
read it **backwards**. Forwards, every one of `Tuple`'s three `head` members
resolved to the innermost: wrong values, right types, no diagnostic.

**Still refused, and each says so by name:** binding a *reference* to a base
subobject (`Tuple<Rest...> &tail() { return *this; }` - the pointer form
works), and a template-id as a qualified name in an expression
(`Tuple<Rest...>::depth()`).

**A test-case rule this cost a Windows round to learn: a case that prints
`sizeof` may not contain `long`.** It is 8 bytes on the two Itanium targets
and 4 on Windows, so such a case measures the data model rather than the
layout and no single `.expected` can serve all three. `double` is 8
everywhere. All three failures on the Windows box were this and none was the
layout work.

## Where this came from

Forked from `../Compiler-C` on 2026-08-26, at the whole-tree level rather than
just `src/backend/`. The reason is mechanical: `src/backend/Backend.h` is
written against `src/Ast.h` and `src/Type.h`, so taking the backend means
taking the AST, and once the AST comes across the Lexer, Preprocessor and
Driver are free. What was bought is three working code generators —
`x86_64-linux`, `x86_64-windows` (MASM) and `arm64-darwin` — plus DWARF, the
`Abi`/`Spelling`/target split, and toolchain discovery. **The work goes into
the front end.**

The fork is a copy, not a git remote: the history in Compiler-C is about C.
Fixes do not flow between the trees automatically, and divergence in
`src/backend/` is expected rather than accidental — C++ needs mangling,
vtables, exception tables and `__cxa_guard`, none of which C may ever grow.

`tests/c-corpus/` is Compiler-C's 425 cases, inherited and **untriaged**. Much
of it is valid C++11 and much is not (implicit `void *` conversions, `new` as
an identifier). Do not report a number from it as a pass rate until it has
been triaged case by case.

A different 43 started compiling when `wchar_t` became a keyword type rather
than a typedef. `<stddef.h>` had been declaring `typedef int wchar_t;` since
rung 1 made `wchar_t` a keyword, so **the whole of `lib/` had been unusable
and nothing noticed** - no case in the suite included a header, and the corpus
cases that do were already failing for their own reasons. `wchar_t` is a type
of its own in C++ and is spelled in the parser now.

43 of those cases stopped compiling when `const` entered the type system, and
all 43 are the same C idiom: `int printf(char *fmt, ...);` handed a string
literal, which is an array of *const* char in C++11. clang refuses all 43 as
well. **Ask clang about a corpus case with
`clang++ -x c++ -std=c++11 -pedantic-errors`, and nothing less.** Without
`-x c++` it compiles a `.c` file as C and agrees with everything; without
`-pedantic-errors` the string-literal rule is only a warning, kept that way
for old C++. Both defaults quietly turn the oracle into a rubber stamp.

A case in `tests/cases/` can be handed straight to
`clang++ -x c++ -std=c++11` now, because the cases declare what they take from
the C library inside `extern "C"` - which is what a C++ program has to do, and
what the earlier sed-a-copy stopgap was standing in for. Every `.expected` in
the suite is clang's own output.

## What makes C++ different from C to parse

Two facts shape the whole front end, and a design that ignores either has to be
redone:

**Parsing needs the symbol table.** `T * x;` is a declaration or a
multiplication depending on how `T` was declared. There is no clean
lex → parse → check pipeline; lookup runs during parsing. cc1's parser already
tracks typedefs for exactly this reason, which is the seam the C++ work grows
from.

**Two-phase name lookup was a day-one decision, and it has been taken the
other way.** This file used to say the parser must distinguish dependent from
non-dependent names before templates parse, because getting it wrong is the
classic rewrite. Rungs 1 to 4 shipped without doing so, and rung 5 is planned
around instantiating a template by **replaying its tokens** rather than by
building a dependent AST - which means every name in a template body is looked
up at instantiation. The reasoning, and what it costs, is in the rung-5 section
below; it is a decision rather than a drift, and it is the one to revisit first
if templates ever feel wrong.

## The ladder

Each rung is a language someone could write a real program in, and each one
compiles, assembles, links and runs on all three targets before the next
starts. No half-built pipelines waiting on a later phase.

| | Rung | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | The fork: C90 through three backends | **done**, 2026-08-26 |
| 1 | C++ as a better C: keywords, `bool`, tag names, `::` | **done**, 2026-08-26 |
| 2 | References, overloading, **Itanium/MSVC mangling**, `new`/`delete` | **done**, 2026-08-28 |
| 3 | `class`: members, access, ctors/dtors, `this`, RAII | **done**, 2026-08-28 |
| 4 | Inheritance → virtual functions and vtables → multiple inheritance | **done**, 2026-08-29 |
| 5 | Templates: function → class → deduction → partial spec → SFINAE → variadic | **done**, 2026-08-29 |
| 6 | Exceptions: `__cxa_*`, `.gcc_except_table`, unwind data | **done** on all three targets, 2026-08-30 - `return` inside a `catch` is refused on Windows |
| 7 | The C++11 layer: `auto`, `decltype`, move, lambdas, `constexpr`, range-for | **done**, 2026-08-30 - every C++11 capture included |

## Where this stands, 2026-09-01

**The ladder is walked.** All eight rungs compile, assemble, link and run on
x86_64-linux, x86_64-windows and arm64-darwin. Suites at the last commit:

| | run | emit | names vs clang | overload | names vs cl |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mac | 223 | 348 | 117 | 26 | - |
| Linux | 223 | 348 | - | - | - |
| Windows | 220 | - | - | - | 93 |

**Those numbers are 2026-09-01's and are kept as the record of that day; they
are not what the tree measures now.** The newest `docs/HANDOVER-*.md` carries
the current ones, which is where to look - a table in the middle of a file
written in the order things happened will always be behind, and quietly
correcting it in place would lose the date it was true. At 2026-09-08, from the
Windows box: emit 735, `names.sh` 249/1, `overload.sh` 30/0, and the Windows
cases 235/0 through *both* assembly spellings.

**Two of the four suites only ever run on one machine.** `names.sh` and
`overload.sh` both ask clang, and the Linux box has no clang++ - they skip
themselves there and say so. So the oracle half of three-box verification is
the Mac's, with the Windows box asking cl separately. Worth knowing before
reading a green Linux run as agreement with anything.

Since the ladder finished, the work has been **C++11 features that were never
rungs** - each one measured against clang, and against cl for a Microsoft-ABI
question, before anything was written:

| Feature | Landed | What it turned on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `namespace`, `using namespace` | 2026-08-30 | scopes in a tag, and lookup as a search |
| `nullptr` | 2026-08-30 | a null constant that is not the integer 0 |
| `static_assert` | 2026-08-30 | a declaration that declares nothing |
| `explicit` | 2026-08-30 | copy-initialization, in its three places |
| `const_cast`, `reinterpret_cast` | 2026-08-30 | the const line between the two |
| `noexcept` | 2026-08-30 | the specifier and the operator |
| catching by reference | 2026-09-06 | the ordinary spelling of `catch`, for every type |
| the eleven alternative tokens, then the six digraphs | 2026-09-06 | a lexer rewrite; nothing in the parser has a rule for them |
| dynamic initialisation | 2026-09-06 | a constructor running before `main`, and four refusals with it |
| `volatile`, as a line drawn | 2026-09-07 | object versus type: kept where it costs nothing, refused where a linkage name is made from it |
| `dynamic_cast<void *>` | 2026-09-07 | the most derived object - inline on Itanium, `__RTCastToVoid` on Microsoft |
| range-based `for` over a class | 2026-09-07 | `begin()`/`end()` as members, and the containers in `include/` walkable |
| one type, one selector index | 2026-09-07 | the parser and the backend numbering alike, and a `try` in a handler refused rather than miscompiled |
| a destructible object inside a `try` body | 2026-09-07 | the body's cleanup rows carrying the `try`'s catch types and handing over to one chain |
| a thrown temporary with a destructor | 2026-09-07 | the exception object copy-constructed, the operand's temporaries destroyed, and its destructor named |
| the implicit destructor of an intermediate class | 2026-09-07 | a three-level hierarchy links; `synthesizeDestructor` marks its base's destructor used |
| `<exception>` and `<stdexcept>` | 2026-09-07 | the standard's nine classes over a `std::string`, and `catcher1.cpp` running |
| the `__has_*` predicates | 2026-09-07 | `__has_include` answered, the rest told no, and a comment on a directive line |
| disjoint call-site regions | 2026-09-07 | a `try` inside a `catch`, and rows that can finally be sorted |
| a `try` inside a `try` | 2026-09-07 | the action chain continuing outwards and the pad handing over - all three lambdaTest programs run |
| a virtual base built once | 2026-09-08 | C1 split from C2, in all three constructor paths; a segfault on the implicit one |
| `<type_traits>` | 2026-09-08 | the C++11 core of it, and an explicit specialization that may name a base |
| `ostream << long double` | 2026-09-08 | the overload that did not exist, and `snprintf` under it |
| clang as the COFF assembler | 2026-09-08 | COMDAT, so a multi-file C++ program links on Windows - Compiler++ does |
| the GNU spelling catches | 2026-09-08 | a try map and a handler map where there had been neither |

Each has a section further down saying what was measured and what was
deliberately not built. **The table stopped at 2026-08-30 for a week and the
last five rows were added on 2026-09-07**, which is worth knowing about any
index in this file: the sections are written as the work lands and the summary
in front of them is not, so a gap here means nobody updated it, never that
nothing happened.

### What to do next, and why in this order

**The two try/catch limits come first**, and they were promoted from footnotes
to a prerequisite by `noexcept`: a local with a destructor and a `try` in one
function is refused, and on x86_64-windows a handler is a funclet that cannot
`return`. Both are recorded under rung 6 as their own gaps. They now also block
enforcing a `noexcept` specification at run time - which is the one entry in
`docs/CONFORMANCE.md` whose fix is otherwise small - so lifting them buys two
things rather than one.

Then, roughly by what else depends on it:

* **Conversion functions** (`operator int()`, `explicit operator bool()`).
  There are none at all, which is why `explicit` on one is refused naming the
  conversion function rather than the keyword.
* **A mem-initialiser calling a class member's constructor with an argument** -
  `H() : t(3) {}` where `t` is a class. Refused today whether or not anything
  is `explicit`.
* **Parenthesised direct-init of a scalar**, `int n(5);`. Small, and it is what
  makes `bool b(nullptr);` unreachable - the one measured `nullptr` case that
  cannot be written here.
* **`T(3);` as a bare statement**, and **a null pointer to member function**,
  which has no value by any spelling because it is two words on both ABIs.

**`dynamic_cast` is a rung of its own, not a fourth branch beside the other
casts**: it needs a `type_info` beside each vtable, the inheritance graph it
carries, and the `__cxa_` call that walks it. None of that is emitted today.

Rung 1 in full: the C++11 keyword table, the `::`, `.*` and `->*`
punctuators, `__cplusplus`, `bool`/`true`/`false`, class and enum tags as type
names, and character literals typed `char` rather than `int`. Mixed
declarations and `for`-init scope came across from Compiler-C already working
and now have cases holding them there. `auto` as a deduced type is refused by
name and belongs to rung 7.

**Rung 2 is done in dependency order, and `const` comes first.** The type
system inherited from Compiler-C had no qualifier at all: constness was a bool
on the declared object, and a pointee's const was discarded, so `const char *`
and `char *` were the same `Type`. Nothing else in the rung can be built on
that. A mangler cannot spell `PKc` for a type that does not exist, and
matching clang's mangled names is the whole reason for having the oracle;
overload resolution cannot rank `f(char *)` against `f(const char *)` if they
are one function. So the order is: `const` in the type system, then
references, then `extern "C"` and mangling, then overloading, then
`new`/`delete`. All five are done, and the order was the right one twice over:
overload resolution could not have ranked `f(char *)` against
`f(const char *)` before `const` was a property of the type, and the two
overloads could not have reached the linker as different functions before the
mangler existed.

**`new` and `delete` call the platform's four operator functions by name, and
those names were measured rather than read** - `clang++ -target ... -S -O0`
over a file that allocates, for each target. At `-O1` clang elides the
allocation, which it is allowed to do, and the assembly comes back with
nothing in it to read.

    operator new(size_t)      _Znwm    ??2@YAPEAX_K@Z
    operator new[](size_t)    _Znam    ??_U@YAPEAX_K@Z
    operator delete(void *)   _ZdlPv   ??3@YAXPEAX@Z
    operator delete[](void *) _ZdaPv   ??_V@YAXPEAX@Z

Calling the platform's operators rather than shipping an allocator is what
makes a `new` here and a `delete` in an object built by clang the same
allocation. It also decided the link line: **the driver links with `c++`, not
`cc`**, because those four live in libc++ or libstdc++ and the C driver links
neither - `new int` compiled and assembled and then failed with four undefined
symbols the linker had helpfully demangled. On Windows they are already in
`libcmt.lib`, which was measured on the box with `dumpbin /linkermember`
rather than assumed.

Refused by name rather than half-built: placement new and a parenthesised
type-id after `new` (both need rung 3 to be worth having, and they read the
same way to the parser, so one message says how to write the other), more than
one value in a new-expression, `new T[n][m]`, `new T[n](...)`, and `delete` of
a `void *`. `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` records the one thing that compiles and is
not the standard's answer: a failed allocation terminates rather than throwing,
because the platform's operator throws and there is no handler until rung 6.

**The linkage name is computed in the parser and carried beside the source
name.** `Var`, `Call` and `Function` each answer `name()` for people and
`symbol()` for the linker, and the backends emit the second - including in
label prefixes, because two overloads will share a name and must not share a
label. `src/Mangle.cpp` holds both ABIs: Itanium on Linux and Darwin,
Microsoft on Windows, chosen by `Target::microsoftNames()`.

What is *not* mangled: anything inside `extern "C"`, `main`, and a variable
with internal linkage. What is: every other function, and on Windows every
externally-visible variable. Internal linkage says so in an Itanium name -
`_ZL5twicei` - and does not in a Microsoft one.

**Every rule in the mangler was measured, not read.** clang will spell either
ABI on any machine:

```
clang++ -target x86_64-linux-gnu       -S     # Itanium
clang++ -target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -S     # Microsoft
```

`tools/mangled-names case.cpp` puts cxx1's names beside clang's for all three
targets, and `tests/names.sh` runs it over every case in the suite - the third
suite, and the one that says the platform ABI was conformed to rather than
approximated. It skips itself where there is no clang, saying so.

Two things that surprised: MSVC numbers are the value minus one as a digit up
to ten and the value itself in hexadecimal above that, and a const array
element is written `$$CB` rather than by qualifying the array. Both are in the
comments where they are used.

**A reference is lowered to a pointer, and the parser is where it stops.**
`Kind::LValueRef` exists in the type system, so a function's type can record
that a parameter is `int &` - overload resolution and the mangler will both
need that - but no backend ever sees one. `Parser::useReference` turns every
mention of a reference into a dereference of the slot holding its address, and
from that point on assignment, address-of, member access and subscripting see
an ordinary lvalue. `Parser::bindReference` is the other half: binding is
taking an address, and where there is no address to take - a value, a
bit-field, a `register` object, a converted type - a const reference gets a
temporary in the frame and everything else is refused by name.

The one asymmetry to remember: `sizeof` a reference asks about what it refers
to, while the *frame slot* is a pointer. `Type::size` answers the first and
`allocateFrameSlot` the second, and those are the only two places that differ.

Refused by name rather than half-built: rvalue references (`&&`, rung 7), a
reference member of a class (it needs a constructor, rung 3), a reference at
file scope (it needs binding before `main`), a reference to a reference, an
array of references, a pointer to a reference, and a cv-qualified reference.
Also `?:` as an lvalue, which is real C++ and would let `return c ? a : b;`
bind a reference - it is a Conditional here and Conditional is not an lvalue.

**`const` is a property of the type, and a qualified type is a second `Type`
that forwards.** `TypeTable::withConst` interns a copy carrying `unqual_`, and
everything that depends on state a struct gains *later* - its members, its
size, whether it is complete - is asked of the unqualified one rather than of
the copy, which was taken before the struct was finished. The trap to know
about: every interning loop in `Type.cpp` must skip qualified types. A
`char * const` is a `Kind::Pointer` whose pointee is `char`, so a `pointerTo()`
that did not skip it would hand it back for `char *` and quietly make every
such pointer in the file read-only.

**Not in rung 1, and deliberately**: a declaration in an `if` or `while`
condition. It needs the condition's scope to wrap both branches, which is a
change to how `If` is built rather than an addition to it. **Landed
2026-09-04**, and that description held - see "A declaration in a condition,
and the two rules that are not one rule".

**Rung 3 is done in dependency order too, and `class` with access control
comes first**, for the same reason `const` did: the member table has to carry
who may name a member before anything can decide whether a use is allowed. A
class and a struct build the same type through the same function and differ in
one thing - where access starts, private or public - which is what
[class.access] says they differ in. `protected` is recorded distinctly even
though nothing can yet tell it from `private`, because inheritance is what
tells them apart and revisiting every declaration then would be the more
expensive order.

**There is no "inside" yet**, so from anywhere a non-public member is out of
reach. That is not a half-check: a class with private data and no member
functions is closed, and member functions are the next step. `Type` records
which keyword defined it so a diagnostic says "class Account" about something
written as a class - only a *definition* sets that, since `class X;` followed
by `struct X { }` is one type written two ways and the standard allows the mix.

**Member functions are free functions with one extra leading pointer**, and
that is why the backends needed nothing: `this` is parameter zero and every
backend already knew how to pass a pointer. It is bound before any written
parameter so it takes the first slot, and it is deliberately not in the
signature's `params` - that vector is the declared type, which is what
overload resolution ranks and the mangler spells, and `this` is in neither.

A member is keyed in the one function table as `"Point::get"`, which is what
gave members overload resolution with no second implementation of it: two
members with different parameters are two entries under that key, exactly as
two free functions would be.

**Both ABIs spell the class into the name, and only Microsoft spells in the
access** - Q public, I protected, A private, measured. So a member that changes
from private to public changes its symbol on Windows and keeps it on Linux. A
const member function is `_ZNK...` and `...QEBA...`, and const is part of which
member it is: `get()` and `get() const` are two functions.

**An empty class became legal here with this step**, and that was not a loose
end: a class holding only member functions has no data members, and C's rule
that a struct needs one would have refused the ordinary shape of a class that
carries behaviour and no state. Size is one byte so two objects have different
addresses.

Refused by name rather than half-built: a member function **defined inside**
the class body, because the body would have to see members declared after it -
which means holding it until the class is closed, and that is a change to when
parsing happens rather than an addition to it; a nested class; a member
function of a union; and a member function declared out of line that the class
never declared.

**A constructor is a member function whose name is its class and whose return
type is nothing**, so it is keyed under `"Point::Point"` and every piece of the
overload machinery applies unchanged - `Point()` and `Point(int,int)` are two
entries a construction chooses between. The object exists before the call, as
a frame slot like any other local; the constructor gives its members values.

Two things had to be taught rather than reused. `Point::Point(...)` has **no
type before a name that IS a type**, so `specifiers()` declines it - answers
void and consumes nothing - which leaves the declarator's qualified-name path
to read `Point::Point` exactly as it reads `Point::get`. And `Point p(1)` and a
function declaration look the same until the type is known to be a class with
constructors, so that question is asked before the block-function branch.

**Itanium gives a constructor two names and both are emitted**: C1 for a
complete object, C2 for a base subobject. A construction calls C1 - measured,
by reading which one clang's call names - and nothing calls C2 until a derived
class does, but an object file missing it is not the object file clang
produces. `Function::alias` carries the second name and the two Itanium
backends emit it as a label in front of the body, which is one address with two
names rather than two copies of the code. The Microsoft ABI has one name, ??0,
and writes '@' where a member function writes its return type.

Refused by name: a constructor defined inside the class body, a variadic
constructor, a static local with a constructor (it would have to run before
main), copy-initialisation `Point p = ...` (it needs a copy constructor), and
`Point p();` - which declares a function, and a compiler that quietly built an
object there would compile a program that means something else everywhere else.

**RAII is one list read backwards at the right moments.** `alive_` holds what
has been constructed and not yet destroyed, innermost last; a block destroys
what it added, a `return` destroys everything the function still owes, and
`delete` destroys before it frees - the order measured from clang, which calls
D1 and then `_ZdlPv`.

**A return computes its value before running destructors**, into a slot of its
own. That is not a detail: the expression may read an object that is about to
be destroyed, and without the temporary the function would return a value taken
out of an object after its destructor had been told it was finished.

**A jump out of a scope destroys what the scope built, innermost first**,
before it goes - [stmt.jump]/2, and the same calls the scope's end makes,
through the same `destroyObject`. `return` has always done it for the whole
function. `break` and `continue` do it for everything built since their loop
or switch body was entered - a mark on `alive_` taken after a `for`'s
init-statement, so `for (S s; ...)` keeps its `s` across a break. A `goto`
cannot know at the time what it leaves, since a forward label has not been
read, so it is emitted as a block in front of the jump, left empty, and
`resolveGotos()` fills it with the calls for every object alive at the goto
and not at the label. Measured against clang over ten shapes in
`tests/cases/jump-out-destroys` - two scopes at once, a loop body, a
backward jump, a switch, an inner loop only, several objects in one scope,
an object destroyed only through a member's destructor - with identical
output.

Before this, `break` and `continue` were refused whenever anything at all
was alive, and `goto` was not refused at all: its half of that test sat on a
line the goto branch had already returned from, and `{ S s; goto out; }`
compiled and never ran `~S`. Found 2026-09-02 while mending the rule below;
`tests/cases/goto-out-of-scope` runs it now.

**A jump may not land past an initialisation** - [stmt.dcl]/3, for `goto`
forward, `goto` backward into a block, and a `switch` to its case labels
alike. Each label, goto and switch records which initialised automatic
objects are in scope where it stands - an initialiser, a constructor or a
destructor makes an object count, and an uninitialised scalar, a POD without
an initialiser or a static does not - and a jump whose label holds one its
origin does not is refused at the origin. Before the rule `goto done; S s;
done:` ran `~S` on an object never built, and `goto done; int x = 5; done:
return x;` returned whatever the slot held. Twenty-two shapes measured
against clang with `-x c++ -std=c++11 -pedantic-errors`, all agreeing.

**A braced initialiser does not narrow** - [dcl.init.list]/7, in the four
forms the paragraph lists, on a local, at file scope, and for each member of
an aggregate. A constant source is judged by its value through `fold` and
`foldDouble`, the evaluators every other constant context uses; a
non-constant one by its type alone. `char c = {300}` gave 44 without a word
until it did. Fifty shapes measured against clang, all agreeing - the oracle
needs `-x c++` and `-pedantic-errors`, or it compiles a `.c` as C and keeps
the rule as a warning respectively.

**`tools/mangled-names` asks clang with `-fno-exceptions` now**, and that
change is about the comparison rather than the code: a class with a destructor
makes clang emit a cleanup path - the personality routine, `.gcc_except_table`,
`_Unwind_Resume` - and this compiler has no exceptions until rung 6, so those
symbols read as a disagreement about names when they are a difference in
features. Mangling is unchanged by the flag.

**Multiple inheritance is where "the base is at offset 0" stops being true**,
and every step before it leaned on that. `class C : public A, public B` puts A
at 0 and B at 4 - measured - so `B *pb = &c` is `&c + 4`, and the same four is
what B's member functions expect as `this`. `Type::bases()` carries each base
with its offset; `convert()` moves the pointer, **and keeps a null pointer
null**, because [conv.ptr] says so and `(char *)0 + 4` is not null.

Bases are constructed in the order written and destroyed in reverse. Both
loops walk the list **backwards**, because a constructor's call is prepended
to the body and a destructor's is appended - prepending A last is what leaves
it first. Walking forwards for the constructor put B before A, which the
oracle caught immediately.

**A polymorphic second base needs a secondary vtable and a thunk, and Itanium
has both now.** `_ZTV1C` holds two tables back to back: the primary for A, then
a secondary for B whose first word is **-16**, saying how far back the complete
object is. The object carries two vptrs, at 0 and at B's offset.

A call through a `B *` arrives with `this` pointing at the B subobject, and an
override expects the whole object - so the secondary slot holds a **thunk**
that walks `this` back and calls the real function. clang tail-jumps; cxx1
calls and returns, which costs a frame and behaves identically and needed
nothing new from any backend. The name is `_ZThn16_N1C1gEv`: the prefix, the
offset, then the mangled name with its own `_Z` removed and its `N` kept.

**The Microsoft ABI does not use a thunk at all, and that is a difference in
code generation rather than in naming.** Measured with **cl itself**, from its
own `/FAs` listing:

- Two separate vftable symbols, `??_7C@@6BA@@@` and `??_7C@@6BB@@@`, rather
  than one table in two sections. Each is stored at its own base's offset.
- The second points **straight at `?g@C@@UEAAHXZ`**. There is no adjustor
  symbol anywhere in the object.

The adjustment is inside the override. For `int C::g() { return c*100 + b*10 + a; }`
cl emits

    imul eax, DWORD PTR [rax+16], 100     ; c
    imul ecx, DWORD PTR [rcx+8], 10       ; b
    add  eax, DWORD PTR [rcx-8]           ; a  <- NEGATIVE

so **`this` arrives pointing at the B subobject**, and the first base's members
are reached backwards from it. MSVC compiles the whole function against a
biased `this`; Itanium compiles it against the complete object and puts a thunk
in front.

That is why this is refused on Windows rather than approximated: implementing
it means carrying a `this` bias through member lookup for the whole body of
such an override, not emitting a different symbol. It is a rung-4 remainder
with a known shape, and the shape is written down here so the next attempt
starts from a measurement rather than from a guess.

**A case may now name a target it does not compile for**, one per line in
`<case>.notarget` with the reason on the line, honoured by `tests/emit.sh` and
`tools/mangled-names`. The reason is printed on every run: an exclusion nobody
sees is an exclusion nobody removes.

**Rung 4 opened with single, non-virtual inheritance**, and the base subobject
sits at **offset 0** - measured. So a derived object's address is its base's
address, no pointer adjustment happens anywhere, and passing `this` to a base's
member function is a change of type and nothing else. Multiple inheritance is
what ends that, which is why it is a later step and is refused by name until
then rather than laid out wrongly.

**Data members are copied down and member functions are searched up**, and the
asymmetry is deliberate: a member lives at an offset and can be copied, a
function lives under a name and cannot be without inventing a second symbol for
it. Access travels through the inheritance - a public member of a private base
is private in the derived class.

**A constructor runs the base's first and a destructor runs it last**, calling
the base's **C2 and D2** - the base-object forms. That is the first thing to
call them, and the reason they have been emitted since constructors landed. On
Windows there is one name for each and it is called directly.

Naming a base's constructor needs a mem-initializer list, which does not exist
yet, so a base with no default constructor is refused by name.

**Virtual functions land in two slices: the table, then dispatch.** The first
emits the vtable and sets the vptr and **refuses a call to a virtual function
by name**. A static call would be right whenever the static type happened to
be the dynamic one and silently wrong otherwise, which is the outcome this
project refuses loudest.

A vtable holds **one pointer per virtual function, in the order the base first
declared them**, an override replacing an entry rather than appending - which
is what lets a `Base *` and a `Derived *` agree on where to look. It is emitted
as an ordinary global whose initialiser pieces are symbol addresses, so no
backend was told about vtables at all.

**Finding a base's slot is what makes a function virtual**, not the keyword.
[class.virtual] says an override is virtual whether or not `virtual` is
written again, and a destructor is virtual as soon as a base's is. cxx1 used
to require the keyword, and a class that left it out was dispatched
*statically* - it compiled, ran, and quietly gave the base's answer, which is
the one outcome this project refuses loudest. So the slot search runs *before*
the linkage name is built rather than after: Microsoft spells a virtual member
U and a plain one Q, and getting the dispatch wrong had been getting the name
wrong too. The destructor half is worse than the function half - `delete`
through a `Base *` ran `~Base` alone and the derived class's own cleanup never
happened.

The two ABIs differ in the header, and so in what the vptr holds. Itanium
writes offset-to-top and a typeinfo pointer first and the vptr points at
**table + 16** - measured from the `addq $16` in clang's own constructor. The
typeinfo slot was a plain 0 when this was written, there being no RTTI here,
which is also why `tools/mangled-names` asks clang with `-fno-rtti` as well as
`-fno-exceptions`. **`dynamic_cast` filled it** - `ParserClass.cpp:773` - so a
polymorphic class carries a real `_ZTI` today; `typeid` is still refused by
name. Microsoft has no header, so the vptr is the
table's own address, and it spells a virtual member **U** where a non-virtual
public one is Q.

**A base subobject occupies its data size, not its sizeof**, and that bug was
found here rather than reasoned about: a derived class may put its first
member in the base's tail padding. `Base {vptr, int}` ends at twelve and pads
to sixteen, so `Derived`'s int lands at twelve and the whole is sixteen, where
laying it out after `sizeof` gave twenty-four. `Type::dataSize` is the
distinction; it equals `size()` for anything without tail padding, which is why
single inheritance passed without it.

A polymorphic class with no constructor is refused: nothing else sets the vptr,
and an implicit default constructor is not written yet.

**Dispatch reads the slot rather than naming the function**: the object's first
word is the vptr, the slot is at a fixed index - the same index in every class
in the chain, which is what the table's ordering bought - and from there it is
an ordinary indirect call, the machinery a call through a function pointer
already used. It needs `Derived *` to convert to `Base *`, which costs nothing
at run time because the base is at offset 0, and ranks as a pointer conversion
so `f(Derived *)` still beats `f(Base *)` for a `Derived *`.

**Two traps in building AST by hand, both found by running.** A global `Var` is
an lvalue, so naming the vtable *loaded* its first word instead of taking its
address - the array type and `decay` are what yield an address. And a `Binary`
built by hand is not the parser's pointer arithmetic: `+ 2` added two bytes
rather than two entries, so the vptr pointed two bytes into the table's first
word. Both places compute bytes explicitly now and say why.

**A pure virtual holds a slot it has no function for**, and what goes in it is
the runtime's own trap — `__cxa_pure_virtual` on Itanium, `_purecall` on
Microsoft, both measured. The vtable is still emitted and the constructor still
stores it, because an abstract class is built as a base subobject every time a
derived one is.

**`= 0` is a specifier and not an initialiser**, so it is read where the
exception specification is read rather than anywhere a value would be. The
function may still have a body — C++ allows one and a derived class can call it
explicitly — so the *symbol* is unchanged and only the table entry differs.

**Abstract is a question about the finished table, not about what the class
declared.** A derived class that overrides every pure entry has replaced them
and is concrete; one that leaves any is abstract in its turn, even though it
declared no pure virtual of its own. `VSlot::pure` carries it and an override
clears it, which is the same machinery that already replaced the symbol.

**The refusal is where an object would be made, not where the call would
happen** — a local, a member, a `new` — because by the time the call is reached
there is nothing left to say about it. It names the function that has no
implementation, which is the thing the reader has to write.

Worth knowing about how this was found: pure virtuals were missing and
`docs/EXCLUSIONS.md` did **not** list them, because the refusal was a bare
`expected ';'` rather than a message naming the feature. That is the same
defect the exclusions document exists to catch, one level down, and it is why
the rule there is that a refusal says "is not supported yet" or names a
standard version.

**A virtual destructor puts a function in the vtable that no program writes.**
`delete p` through a base pointer has to reach the right destructor and then
free, so one slot does both and holds a *deleting* destructor. cxx1
synthesizes it - there is no source for it - and emits it as ordinary AST, so
no backend knows it was invented.

The ABIs diverge here more than anywhere else, both measured. Itanium takes
**two adjacent slots**, D1 for the complete object and D0 for the deleting
form, and `delete` calls the second. Microsoft takes **one**, `??_G`, which
takes a flag beside `this`, frees only when its low bit is set - so a non-heap
object can reach the same slot safely - and returns `this`. cl spells it
`??_GBase@@UEAAPEAXI@Z` and so does cxx1.

`delete[]` of a polymorphic type is refused by name: it needs the element count
and the dynamic type, and neither is recorded.

**T union, U struct, V class** in a Microsoft name. Until vtables nothing
declared with `class` had its type reach a name, so U covered both; clang and
cl both write `?viaPointer@@YAHPEAVShape@@@Z` where cxx1 wrote `...PEAUShape...`.
Itanium spells all three by tag and does not care.

**A member function defined inside its class is held, not parsed where it is
met.** Its body may name members declared below it, so nothing in it can be
read until the class is closed. The class body records the token the whole
declaration starts at, steps over the braces, and `replayInlineBodies` re-reads
those tokens once the class is complete - through the ordinary out-of-line
definition path, so constructors, `this`, init lists, destructors and virtuals
needed no second implementation. `inlineOwner_` supplies the `Class::` the
source does not have and is **one-shot**, cleared by the first declarator that
uses it, so declarations inside the body stay ordinary locals.

**The replay begins after `virtual`, not at it.** Out of line the keyword is
not written - C++ puts it on the declaration inside the class and nowhere else
- so the recorded token has to be the one after it, or the ordinary path is
handed a `virtual` that `specifiers()` will not read. It was, and every
virtual function written inside its class was a parse error until this was
fixed: `error: expected a type`, pointing at the keyword.

**The three special members a class does not write, the compiler does** -
default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment - and the first thing
to know is that **a trivial one is not a function at all**. That is measured,
with cl first: for a class with no virtual function and no member that needs
building, cl emits no symbol for any of the three, and clang emits none on
either Itanium target either. So a plain class is copied by moving its bytes -
the struct assignment this compiler has emitted since it was a C compiler -
and no implicit member is declared for it, which is what keeps the symbol
lists level with the oracles' and leaves the old C path untouched.

An implicit member is declared where it has *work* to do: a virtual function,
whose vptr somebody has to store, or a base or member with a special member of
its own to run. And it is given a body only when something calls it, which is
[class.copy]'s own rule about implicit *definition* and also what cl does -
`??0Poly@@QEAA@XZ` appears because a `Poly` is built, not because `Poly` is
declared. `defineImplicitFunctions` runs at the end of the file and to a fixed
point, since giving one class a body can be what first calls another's.

**A copy constructor stores the vptr and a copy assignment does not**, which
is the only difference between the two bodies and was read out of cl's own
listing:

    ??0Poly@@QEAA@AEBU0@@Z   lea rcx, OFFSET FLAT:??_7Poly@@6B@   <- its own
                             mov QWORD PTR [rax], rcx
                             mov ecx, DWORD PTR [rcx+8]           <- then members
    ??4Poly@@QEAAAEAU0@AEBU0@@Z
                             mov ecx, DWORD PTR [rcx+8]           <- members only

The reason is that a constructor is *making* an object, so the new object is of
this class whatever the source was, while assignment writes into one that is
already of this class. A polymorphic class is non-trivial for *both*, even
though only one of them touches the vptr.

**Members are copied one at a time and not as one block.** A base subobject
occupies its data size rather than its sizeof, so a derived class may have put
a member of its own in this class's tail padding - and a `sizeof`-sized copy
through the C2 form would take that member with it. Where a base has a copy of
its own, its call is emitted and the members it covers are skipped: they are in
this class's member list too, because data members are copied down.

**An array member is copied by a loop**, `int i = 0; while (i < n) { ... }`,
built as ordinary AST. N statements would have been simpler and is wrong: the
count is a property of the type and nothing bounds it. The element addresses
are computed in *bytes*, index times element size - a Binary built by hand gets
none of the parser's pointer scaling, the same trap the vptr store hit.

**`operator=` is the one operator this compiler spells**, and both ABIs were
measured: Itanium writes the two-letter code `aS` where a member function
writes the length and letters of its name, and no return type -
`_ZN4PolyaSERKS_`. Microsoft replaces the whole `?name@` with `??4` and, unlike
`??0`, *does* write the return type - `??4Poly@@QEAAAEAU0@AEBU0@@Z`. Only the
class is pushed as a name there, so it is back-reference 0 where a named member
function would leave it 1. The rest of the operators arrive with operator
overloading; until then `operator` is refused by name.

**Copy-initialisation came with the copy constructor** and is not a separate
feature: `X b = a;` is a constructor called with one argument, chosen by the
ordinary overload rules, so `Conv c = 5;` picks a converting constructor by the
same road. What the standard adds here is that an `explicit` constructor may
not be picked, and `explicit` is refused by name until rung 7.

`X q(p);` for a class with no constructor at all is the lowering trade again:
there is no constructor to call, so it becomes the assignment the backends
already emit. A parameter list begins with a type name and this does not, which
is what tells the two apart - the same question the constructor path asks, from
the other side.

Refused by name rather than half-built: a base or member whose default
constructor takes arguments, where the implicit one has no way to name them -
the message says to write a constructor with an initialiser list; and a base or
member whose special member is private or protected. A class with a `const`
member simply has no implicit copy assignment declared, which is [class.copy]'s
deleted one arriving as "there is no such function" rather than as a wrong one.

**Passing a class by value is a copy constructor call, and that changes how it
is passed.** Measured with cl first and confirmed on both Itanium targets: a
class with a **non-trivial copy constructor** goes **by address whatever its
size**, where a trivially copyable class of the same size goes in a register.
The two halves are one change - making the copy happen means the callee has to
be handed the address of storage the caller owns - and neither is right
without the other.

`Type::nonTrivialCopy()` is where the two sides agree. It is set when the
class is completed, exactly when a copy constructor exists for it - written or
just implicitly declared - and it is read by `returnsIndirectly` in the parser
and by the two code generators, so nothing has to re-derive it.

**Both sides are lowered in the parser, so the backends needed almost
nothing.** The parameter becomes a **reference**: its frame slot holds the
caller's pointer and every mention of it dereferences, which is the machinery
references already had. The argument becomes `(ctor(&tmp, arg), &tmp)` - one
expression, so it works wherever a call does. What the backends see on both
sides is a pointer. The only thing they were told is that such a class is
returned through a hidden pointer whatever its size.

**The caller makes the copy and the caller destroys it** - Itanium's rule,
and clang emits the destructor of the argument temporary at the call site.
**cl puts that on the callee**, measured: `?useE@@YAHUE@@@Z` destroys its own
parameter. cxx1 follows Itanium on all three targets; `docs/CONFORMANCE.md`
records what that costs, which is nothing until a cxx1 object is linked with a
cl object.

**A temporary dies at the end of the full expression, not when the call it was
made for returns**, and that is visible rather than pedantic:
`printf("%d", takeNoisy(d))` destroys the copy *after* the printf. So the
temporaries are collected in `pendingTemps_` and `endFullExpression` empties
the list at the places an expression becomes a statement or a condition. A site
that forgets to call it does not lose the destructor - the temporary stays on
the list and goes at the next full expression - so the failure mode is late
rather than absent.

**Copy elision is permitted rather than required in C++11, and the two oracles
take different options**: clang elides at `-O0`, cl does not at `/O0`. cxx1
elides in the two places worth having it - a declaration initialised by a call
that already returns the class through a hidden pointer, and such a call passed
straight in as an argument. In both, the callee builds its result where the
object had to end up anyway, which is one `setResultSlot` and no copy. It also
means a case that *counts* constructor calls has no single right answer, and
`tests/cases/by-value.cpp` says so and does not count them.

The check that says this is right is not the suite: **an object cxx1 compiled
links with one clang compiled, in both directions, and the program prints what
the all-clang build prints.** A mangled name can be diffed, but a calling
convention has to be run.

**A static data member is one object shared by the class**, and the whole of
what makes it different from a global is where its name comes from. It takes no
room in the layout - `Type::StaticMember` is kept apart from `members()` so
that neither the size computation nor anything walking the members has to learn
to skip it - and it is **searched up through the bases** rather than copied
down, the way a member function is, because it lives under a name and not at an
offset.

Both ABIs spell the class into the name and **only Microsoft spells in the
access**, as a *digit* where a member function writes a letter - `2` public,
`1` protected, `0` private, measured with cl:

    ?pub@C@@2HA   ?prot@C@@1HA   ?priv@C@@0HA        _ZN1C3pubE (all three)

**`static const int k = 5;` written inside the class needs no definition and
gets no symbol** - measured, cl folds the value in - so it is kept as a value
on the `StaticMember` and read back as one. Anything else with an initialiser
inside the class is refused: the definition outside is where the storage comes
from and the value belongs with it.

Three ways to name one and they all reach the same object: `C::n`, `obj.n` and
`p->n`, plus the unqualified `n` inside a member function, which is found by
name rather than through `this` because it needs no object at all. `obj.n`
still *evaluates* obj - [expr.ref] - but where that expression is pure there is
nothing to evaluate, and dropping it is what leaves an ordinary lvalue rather
than a comma, which is what `b.count = 1` and `&b.count` need. A comma is an
lvalue here when its right operand is, which is C++'s rule and not C's.

`Counter::total = 1;` as a *statement* had to be taught to `atDeclarationStart`,
which otherwise saw a name that names a type and tried to read a declaration. A
declaration whose type is written `C::something` needs a nested class and is
refused, so an identifier naming a class followed by `::` always begins an
expression here.

Refused by name: a static member *function* (the data member is what this step
is), a static member of a class with a constructor - it would have to run
before main, the same mechanism a static local with a constructor needs - and
an initialiser inside the class for anything but a `static const` of integer
type.

**Two Microsoft data-symbol bugs came out on the way**, both pre-existing and
both measured with cl, because a static member is spelled with exactly the same
machinery a namespace-scope variable is:

    int arr[3]        ?arr@@3PAHA        an array decays; cxx1 wrote Y02H
    int m2[2][3]      ?m2@@3PAY02HA      to a pointer to its element
    S *self           ?self@@3PEAUS@@EA  the qualifier carries E as well
    const char *ccp   ?ccp@@3PEBDEB      and repeats the POINTEE's const

The last is the surprising one: `ccp` is a mutable pointer to const char and
the qualifier after the type says `B` all the same.

**A class written inside another one** takes no room in the enclosing object -
`struct Inner { ... };` in a class body declares a type and no member - and
what it gains is a name. `Type::tag()` becomes the *qualified* one,
"Outer::Inner", because every table here is keyed by it and a nested class must
not collide with a global of the same name; `localName()` is the single
component, which is what both ABIs spell; and `enclosing()` is the class it was
written in.

**Both ABIs spell the whole scope, and both compress it**, measured with cl and
confirmed with clang:

    _ZN5Outer5Inner3getEv          ?get@Inner@Outer@@QEAAHXZ
    _ZN5Outer5Inner6sharedE        ?shared@Inner@Outer@@2HA
    _ZN5Outer3useENS_5InnerE       ?use@Outer@@QEAAHUInner@1@@Z

The last line is the one to understand. Itanium makes **each enclosing class a
substitution candidate of its own**, so inside a member of Outer the parameter
type Outer::Inner is `N S_ 5Inner E` - Outer found in the table rather than
spelled again. Microsoft lists the scopes innermost first and back-references
them the same way, and `1` there is Outer. `Itanium::prefix` and
`Microsoft::scopeOf` are the two functions that do it, and every name that
names a class goes through one of them.

**The scope is walked at lookup rather than kept as a stack of tables.** The
one type-name table this parser has is flat and keyed by the qualified name;
`findTypedef` falls back through `classStack_` - the classes whose bodies are
being parsed - and then `currentClass_`, which is what makes `Inner` mean
`Outer::Inner` inside the class body and inside any member function of it, and
nowhere else.

Three questions had to be re-asked once a name could have more than two
components. `atUntypedMemberDefinition` walks every level to recognise
`Outer::Inner::Inner(` and `Outer::Inner::~Inner(` - a definition whose name is
its class's own and so has no type in front of it. `specifiers` takes the
**longest prefix that names a type**, so `Outer::Inner x;` declares an x rather
than leaving `::Inner` to the declarator. And `atDeclarationStart` answers yes
only where the name *stops* at a type: `Outer::Inner x;` is a declaration where
`Outer::Inner::shared = 1;` is a statement.

`constructorKey` and `destructorKey` take the last component - `localOf` - so
that "Outer::Inner" keys "Outer::Inner::Inner", which is what a definition
outside the class spells.

A nested class is a member, so `private:` reaches it, and the name is refused
where it is written rather than at the first use of an object.

**The destructor a class does not write** is the fourth special member, and it
decides when the other three's work is undone. It becomes a function exactly
when a base or a member has one of its own to run - measured with cl, which
emits `??1Has@@QEAA@XZ` for a class holding members with destructors and no
destructor symbol at all for a class of plain ones.

**A virtual function does not make it non-trivial**, and that is the one worth
writing down because it would have been guessed the other way: cl emits no
destructor for a class with a virtual `f()` and nothing else. What makes it
*virtual* is a base whose destructor is virtual - then it takes over that slot,
gets a deleting form beside it, and `delete` through a base pointer reaches it.
Microsoft writes `U` there where a non-virtual one is `Q`, the same rule a
member function already had and one this compiler was getting wrong for written
virtual destructors too.

Members are undone after the body, in the reverse of the order they were
declared, then the bases in reverse - and an array backwards, which is the
same `eachElement` loop the constructor uses with the index read as
`count - 1 - i`. A base's own destructor deals with the members it brought, so
they are skipped here: they are in this class's member list too, because data
members are copied down.

**Nothing but the constructor path used to add to `alive_`**, so a class with a
member that needed destroying and no constructor of its own was destroyed by
nobody. Any local whose type has a destructor is registered now, constructor or
not - a class can have one and not the other.

Building an array member element by element arrived with this, since the
destructor needed the loop anyway; it had been refused by name until then.

**A member function has an implicit object parameter, and it is ranked like
any other argument** - [over.match.funcs]. That is the whole of what tells
`get()` from `get() const`, and without it a class declaring both could not be
called at all: the two candidates had identical parameter lists and tied.

Binding the object is a reference binding, so it ranks as one:

    object          get()                 get() const
    P               Identity              Qualification   -> get() wins
    const P         not viable            Identity        -> get() const

The last row is why a non-const member on a const object is *unavailable*
rather than merely worse. When it leaves nothing viable, the message that says
so by name is kept - "no function takes these arguments" would send the reader
looking for a parameter mismatch that is not there.

`resolveOverload` takes the object's type and puts its rank in front of the
written arguments', so the best-and-unambiguous machinery below needed nothing
new. Inside a member function the object is `this`, which is what makes a const
member function reach only the const one.

Nothing here is about names: `_ZN1P3getEv` and `_ZNK1P3getEv`, `QEAA` against
`QEBA`, have been two symbols since const member functions landed. It was the
ranking that was missing.

**A class with only a destructor is where the two ABIs genuinely part
company**, and both halves were measured. Itanium passes one **by address**
whatever its size, and the **caller** destroys the copy it made. Microsoft
passes it by the ordinary size rules - in a register if it fits - and the
**callee** destroys its own parameter: cl's `?useSmall@@YAHUSmall@@@Z` calls
`??1Small@@QEAA@XZ` on its parameter before returning, and its caller emits no
destructor for it at all, for the by-address case as much as the register one.
Both return such a class through a hidden pointer.

`Type::hasDestructor()` is the flag, `Parser::passedByAddress` is the rule, and
it is the first thing here that reads `microsoftNames()` to answer a question
about *semantics* rather than about spelling. On Windows a by-value class
parameter with a destructor goes into `alive_` - `Alive::byAddress` says
whether the slot holds the object or a pointer to it - so a `return` unwinds it
with everything else, and the path that falls off the end gets it appended.

**The copy is destroyed at a different moment on the two platforms**, and no
recorded output can cover both: at the end of the full expression on Itanium,
inside the callee on Windows. `tests/cases/by-value-destructor.cpp` takes each
result into a variable before printing it, so the full expression ends before
anything observable happens either way.

**A returned local is not destroyed on the way out.** Its bytes go straight to
the caller's storage and the caller destroys it there - one construction, one
destruction. Destroying it here as well would destroy the same object twice,
which for a class that owns anything is a double free, and it was the shape the
code had: bytes copied *as if* eliding and the local destroyed *as if* not.
Taking the elision is what makes the two consistent, and it is what clang does
at -O0 where cl does not.

**Two exclusion files, and the difference matters.** `<case>.notarget` says
cxx1 cannot compile that case for that target at all - `emit.sh` and
`mangled-names` both read it. `<case>.nonames` says it compiles fine and only
the symbol lists differ for a recorded reason, so emission stays covered and
just the comparison steps aside. Using the first for the second quietly stops
compiling a case that compiles, which is how a suite loses coverage without
anyone noticing.

`docs/CONFORMANCE.md` records what compiles here and should not — currently
that an enumeration is still `int`, and that a class name cannot be hidden by
an object of the same name.

**A parser that loops on bad input is worse than one that says no.** The
specifier loop spun forever on `typedef long T;` where `T` was already a
typedef: `atTypeName()` stayed true and nothing in the loop consumed an
identifier. **Compiler-C has this too** and shipped it through 425 cases,
because no case there redeclares a typedef. Both suites now run every compiler
invocation under `ulimit -t`, so the next one fails rather than wedging the
run.

**Conversion to bool is lowered to a comparison, not taught to the backends.**
`(bool)256` is `true` where `(char)256` is `0`, so the two cannot share a cast
path. `Parser::convert` builds `x != 0` and gives it type `bool`, which every
backend already knows how to emit. This is the pattern to reach for again:
where C++ adds a *conversion*, look for an existing operation to lower it to
before adding a case to three code generators.

## The audit of 2026-09-01, and what it is for

**`docs/audit-2026-09-01.html` is a frozen record and is not to be edited as
things are fixed.** It says what five reviewers found in the tree at 29f8dfb,
with the program and the two outputs for each finding, and its value is that
it is dated: a later reader can tell what was true then from what is true now
only if nobody quietly brings it up to date. Fixes are recorded *here*, in the
table below, and the report stays as written. A second audit gets a second
file beside it rather than an edit to this one.

**What it was.** Five reviewers, one each on C++11 conformance, the C++14
source, the backends and ABI, the written record, and test coverage by
mutation. Every reviewer worked from its own copy of the tree with clang as
the oracle - `clang++ -std=c++11 -pedantic-errors` for the language,
`-target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` for Microsoft names. Twenty-three defects
were confirmed under a suite that was green on all three boxes, seventeen of
them reproduced a second time before being written down.

**The one sentence worth carrying forward:** the suites were green and the
compiler was not, and the mutation pass says why with evidence - nine
deliberate bugs planted in a copy of the tree, and **four survived every
suite**, including unsigned division emitted as signed *on the host target*
and a Windows prologue that writes a garbage frame pointer into every
function.

**The nineteen in the table are closed** - each has a fix and a case, and each
was verified on the boxes available when it was committed.

**Four more were confirmed by a reviewer and never fixed**, and they are listed
below the table rather than in it, which made "all nineteen are closed" read
as more than it says. They are open, they are real, and two of them are silent
wrong answers rather than refusals: a `goto` past an initialisation runs a
destructor on an object that was never constructed, and narrowing in a braced
initialiser turns 300 into 44 without a word. The other two are `const S s;`
for a POD with no user-provided constructor, which C++11 refuses and this
accepts, and an ambiguity [over.ics.rank] requires between `f(int)` and
`f(const int &)` on an lvalue, which is silently resolved. Counting them, the
audit found twenty-three and this compiler has fixed nineteen.

**And the two the report marks as suspected are fixed too, still unreproduced.**
`Trial` restores `angleSplit_` now, alongside the three things it already put
back; and the assignment that wrote a member's position into the *first*
overload's entry is gone - a no-op when the member being defined was that one,
and a corruption of somebody else's recorded position when it was not.

**The `>>` window is reachable, and the claim here that it might not be was
wrong.** It was checked afterwards and a program was built that reaches it.
The premise of the failed attempts was that a substitution failure needs
`typename T::type`; inside a `Trial` *every* `src_.fail` becomes one, so an
ill-formed array length in a nested template argument raises one between the
halves just as well. One subtlety made it hard to find: any intervening `>>`
launders the single-slot flag, so the poisoning call has to come first and the
type that replays those tokens has to be named before it. With the two `split`
lines reverted, the second call meets the stale index, swallows both halves at
the inner list, and a program this compiler accepts fails to parse. So the fix
is not hygiene - it repairs something a program can reach.

The second one had nowhere to show, and that part holds: the only readers of a
`Signature`'s `pos` are the three implicit-special synthesisers, and the old
write's target is always a user declaration. It is deleted rather than
corrected, so nothing remains to misfire.

### The verification round, and the neighbours it found standing

**A verdict of "fixed" was checked by walking one door over from each fix, and
three of the doors were open.** Each of these is the audited fault's own
disease in a shape the fix did not cover, found by the reviewer who re-judged
the audit and mended on `fable/src-mend`.

**A base mem-initialiser never applied default arguments, and read past its
vector.** `: Base(2)` against `Base(int, int = 6)` walked one argument per
*declared* parameter and the shipped compiler died on three lines of ordinary
C++11 - the same default-argument door C-01 came through, in the call that is
built by hand in `topLevel`. `applyDefaults` is applied there now, and
default-building a base goes through overload resolution instead of a search
for an empty parameter list, so a constructor whose every parameter has a
default serves as the default constructor [class.ctor]/5. The case is
`default-arg-base-init.cpp`, and it watches both doors.

**A class summed its members past the count one member is held to.** The
array declarator refuses what C-02 refused, but `alignTo` takes an `int`, and
two 2000000000-byte arrays in one struct were truncated in that call:
`.zerofill` of -294967296, and `sizeof` the same negative number. Refused at
the member list now, in `long long`, padding included - and worth remembering
that **no sanitizer sees this one**, because the truncation is a defined
conversion. `class-too-large.cpp`.

**And C-03's rule - the build machine must not decide a constant - now holds
for every floating constant, not only a suffixed literal.** Three lanes still
diverged by host: a `double` literal was read through the host's `long
double` and rounded twice on one box and once on another (a 72-digit literal
measured `.quad ...409` from the Mac build, `...408` from the Linux build);
a `float` literal the same, one rounding further down; and the constant
folder computed x87 `long double` arithmetic in the host's own type, so one
`+` of two individually exact literals walked past the literal gate. The
lexer reads every literal once with `strtod` - `strtof` under an `f` suffix -
which is single rounding to the value's own type on every host; that is the
one thing taken on the hosts' word, since C requires those correctly rounded,
and doing without them is the software decimal-to-binary rung the literal
gate already named. The folder computes in `double` and refuses, by name, a
folded x87 constant whose exact result does not fit one - measured by
error-free transforms, TwoSum for the additions and an `fma` residue for the
multiplies - and an integer past 53 bits is the same refusal when it reaches
an x87 lane. `float-literal-exact.cpp` pins two literals built to sit
astride the double-rounding boundary.

**The digit test also stopped calling trailing zeros precision.**
`2.5000000000000000000L` overflowed the accumulator and was refused while
`2.5L` was exact, for one value; zeros are deferred to the exponent now and
only multiplied in when a later significant digit needs them. What remains
conservative, deliberately: an exact value whose *significant* digits pass
nineteen - `1180591620717411303424.0L` is 2^70 exactly - still overflows the
64-bit accumulator and is refused. Lifting that means arithmetic on the digit
string itself; it is cheap to want and not cheap to write, and the refusal is
the safe side of the trade the gate already made.

**The `>>` window has a case now, `template-angle-split.cpp`.** The shape
that reaches it: any diagnostic raised inside a `Trial` is a substitution
failure, so instantiating a nested template argument whose *body* is
ill-formed throws between the halves of a `>>` - and an intervening `>>`
anywhere overwrites the one stale mark, which is why the case's typedef sits
above `main` and why the window resisted reproduction the first time.

**Re-judged on `fable/src-mend`, 2026-09-02, one door over from each of the
three.** The tip that recorded the paragraphs above had never been built; it
built, and two of its three fixes stood while the third was missing entirely -
the base mem-initialiser fix had been lost to the `git checkout` its author
reported, and the compiler still died on the audit's three lines. What was
done, and what each was measured against:

- **Default arguments, everywhere a constructor call is built by hand.**
  `defaultConstructorOf` now answers [class.ctor]/5 - a constructor whose
  every parameter has a default *is* the default constructor - instead of
  searching for an empty parameter list, and the five hand-built calls apply
  the defaults: the base a mem-initialiser named with fewer arguments (the
  crash), the base it did not name, the bases and members of the implicit
  default constructor, a local array, and `new M` / `new P(1)` - which was
  refused as "takes 2 argument(s), given 1" after resolution had accepted
  it. `default-arg-member-init.cpp` proves each against clang, with a
  counter in the default to show it is evaluated once per call, three
  times for an array of three. Two constructors that both take nothing are
  refused as before, with the old wording where clang says "ambiguous".
- **The base list, before the member list.** Two 2000000000-byte bases with
  no members of their own passed the member-list guard as a `.zerofill` of
  -294967295, because a base's offset is an `int` and the cursor the guard
  reads is derived from it; a third base wrapped the offset negative before
  the guard saw anything. Refused per base now, where the sum is still a
  sum. `class-too-large-bases.cpp`.
- **Fives, not tens.** The digit test multiplied its accumulator by ten for
  a positive exponent and overflowed at 1e20, so `100000000000000000000.0L`
  - exactly 2^20 * 5^20 - was refused as inexact. It multiplies by five now,
  the twos being free, and an overflow there is the true answer: the odd
  part is past 2^64. 1e22L is accepted and 1e23L refused for x86_64-linux,
  which is the real boundary of a double. `float-literal-tens.cpp`.
- **What is verified about the three floating lanes, and on which box.**
  The strtod/strtof reads and the double-only fold are checked here on the
  Mac, where the host's `long double` is a double and so cannot tell a
  once-rounded read from a twice-rounded one. The Linux build is the one
  that can, and `float-literal-exact.cpp` fails there by printing `0 1 5`
  if a read is still going through `strtold`. Three-box verification has
  not run on this branch yet. The x87 refusals - `0.5L + 2^53`, `1.0L /
  3.0L`, an integer past 53 bits, `1e23L` - were measured by hand for all
  three targets and fire for x86_64-linux alone, but **no case pins a
  refusal that fires for one target only**: `.error` is judged on the host
  target and emit.sh knows no expected refusal. That is a suite change, and
  it was left for the session that owns the three boxes.
- **Found beside the case, not in the audit: a cloned operand lost its
  linker name.** `clonePure` rebuilt a global as `Var::global(name)` and
  dropped the symbol, so on the Windows target `++n` and `n += 1` took the
  address of `n` - `EXTERN n:PROC` - where the definition is `?n@@3HA`. A
  link error on the one target that mangles a variable; the Itanium targets
  cannot show it. Mended in the clone, and the Windows lane of
  `default-arg-member-init.cpp` is what would have failed.

**A user-written constructor builds the class members it does not name.**
[class.base.init]/8: a member the mem-initialiser list leaves out is
default-initialised, and for a class type that is its default constructor.
The implicit constructor did this from the start; a written one did not -
`struct S { M m; S() {} };` with `M() : v(3) {}` left `m` holding the stack,
printed 1 where clang prints 3, and then ran `~M` on it from the destructor
the compiler wrote. A silent wrong answer with a destructor for an object
nothing built. Mended by pulling the member's constructor call out of
`synthesizeDefaultCtor` into `constructMember`, and walking the members
*once*, in declaration order, in both constructors by the first of three
rules that applies: named in the list, own initialiser, class with
constructors. Two things followed from the one walk:

- `: m(args)` on a class-typed member with constructors now *constructs*
  it, through overload resolution and `applyDefaults`, where it was refused
  as an assignment ("'n' is 'struct N' and this is 'int'") - so `: n(9)` and
  a written copy constructor's `: m(o.m)` both reach the right constructor.
  An array member named with arguments is refused by name, as clang refuses
  it.
- The implicit constructor used to apply a member's own initialiser and then
  default-construct the same member over it; the walk applies one rule per
  member, which is what /8's "otherwise" says.

Measured against clang, constructors and destructors printing, in
`member-default-init.cpp`: a user-provided default constructor, an
all-defaulted one, the implicit non-trivial one nested two deep, an array
member, a scalar named beside a class left unnamed, a base beside a member
with either named, a non-default constructor, and two written copy
constructors - every line identical, order included.
`member-default-init-refused.cpp` is the member with no default constructor,
refused where clang refuses it. A union's members are still not built.

**Where that walk meets `: m()`, and which rule owns an empty pair.** The
construction above and the value-initialisation `: m()` were written apart,
against the same function, and the seam between them is one question:
**parentheses with nothing between them are [dcl.init]/8 and not
[class.base.init]/7.** So an entry the list left empty is recorded when the
list is read, and the declaration-order walk asks *that* before it asks what
the member is - construction is never handed an empty argument vector from a
list. It cannot usefully take one: for `: p()` on a plain struct, `: k()` on
an `int`, `: d()` on a `double` or `: arr()` there is no constructor to
reach, and the answer is zeroing, which construction has nothing to say
about. Handing it the empty vector anyway is what refused `: p()` with "'p'
takes one value here, given 0", a form ordinary C++ writes daily.

**And the arity check moved with the construction.** One value per entry used
to be settled in the loop that reads the list, where every entry looks alike;
a class-typed member now takes as many values as one of its constructors
does, so the question is asked further down, after the member's own type has
had its say, and only of the entries that are neither constructed nor
value-initialised. `mem-init-two-rules.cpp` is the seam itself - one list
carrying `: m(1, 2)`, `: p()`, `: k()`, `: d()`, `: m2()`, `: q()`, `: v()`
and `: arr()`, measured against clang with every constructor and destructor
printing - and `mem-init-arity-refused.cpp` is `: k(1, 2)` on an `int`, which
is what proves the check moved rather than went.

**The door beside it, and it is mended now: a class-typed member with its own
initialiser is built from it.** `struct E { M m = M(2); E() {} };` printed
`M2 E ~M | 2 ~M`: the temporary constructed, its bytes *assigned* into storage
nothing had constructed, and then destroyed - one constructor and two
destructors, and for a class that owns anything, the member left holding what
the temporary's destructor had given back.

`memberInitialiser` builds the member through `constructMember` -
[dcl.init]/17 copy-initialisation, the same overload resolution `: m(x)` does,
reaching the copy, the move or a converting constructor - and **the
initialiser's temporaries are destroyed at the end of it**, which they were not.
They sat on the pending list until something else flushed them, so the temporary
died late; once the member was built by a copy rather than handed the bytes, it
would not have died at all. Both halves were needed and the case would have
caught either one alone.

What is left is the elision, recorded rather than open: clang builds `M(2)`
straight into the member and cxx1 makes the copy C++11 also permits. Live-object
counts agree and constructor counts do not, which is why
`member-init-class.cpp` counts the first and why it carries a `.nonames` - the
copy constructor cxx1 emits is one clang never needed.

**What the audit was worth, in the end.** Nineteen defects under a suite that
was green on all three machines, and the fixes added 62 cases - the suite went
from 201 run cases to 223, and from 292 emissions to 348. Four of the fixes
were wrong the first time and the tests said so: a scratch register that held
the base address, a proxy that was true of every synthesised type, a
Microsoft unit rule that forgot a unit is charged for whole, and three
existing cases that turned out to be pinning an ABI's answer as though it were
a fact. Two of those four were caught only by running on the box that owns the
target.

Four more silent wrong answers are recorded in the report and not in this
table because they were confirmed by a reviewer and not re-run here: `goto`
past an initialisation, narrowing in list-initialisation, an ambiguity
[over.ics.rank] requires that is silently resolved, and `const S s;` for a POD.

**Two of those four are fixed, 2026-09-02**, on the Mac and awaiting the
other two boxes: the jump past an initialisation
(`tests/cases/goto-past-initialisation`, with its scalar, backward-into-a-block
and `switch` neighbours), and narrowing in a braced initialiser
(`tests/cases/narrowing-in-braces`, with its aggregate-member and file-scope
neighbours). Mending the first found a third: a `goto` *out* of a block
holding a live object skipped the destructor, because the refusal written for
it was unreachable - a jump destroys what it leaves now, `break` and
`continue` included. The other two of the four stay open.

### C-04: the widest integer there is, and which box decides how wide that is

**[cpp.cond] evaluates a condition in the widest signed integer there is**, and
five levels of this evaluator worked in `long`. A `long` is 64 bits where gcc
and clang build this compiler and 32 where cl does, so a condition holding a
value wider than 32 bits answered differently depending on which of the three
boxes had built the preprocessor reading it - `#if 0x300000002 & 0xFFFFFFFF`
among them. The same source, two answers, and no test could see it from one
machine. The bit-field widths went the same way as the array length before
them, for the same reason.

**And the arithmetic wraps now rather than overflowing.** This evaluator runs
inside a compiler, so "undefined behaviour on overflow" would mean the
compiler itself - negating the most negative value, the one division that
overflows, and a shift count outside 0 to 63 were each reachable from a
`#if` line. The first two are defined through the unsigned type, which is what
every preprocessor a program is likely to have met already does; the third is
refused by name, because a count of 100 is a mistake rather than a large
shift.

### A-03 and C-03: two ABIs' bitfields, and a constant the host was choosing

**One bitfield walk served both ABIs, and it was Itanium's.** Itanium packs
bitfields end to end and lets one allocation unit hold fields of different
declared types. The Microsoft ABI gives each declared type its own unit,
starts a new one whenever the type changes or the current one is full, and
**charges for the whole unit however little of it is used** - that last part
is what decides the size, and it is what the first attempt here missed:
`{int a:3; char b:2;}` puts the char at offset 4, not offset 1. Eight shapes
are pinned in `tests/cases/bitfield-layout.cpp`, each measured with clang for
the ABI it sits under.

**A zero-width bitfield matched neither ABI.** `{char a; int :0; char b;}` is
5 bytes aligned 1 on Itanium and 2 aligned 1 on Windows; cxx1 made it 8
aligned 4, because the `int` was allowed to widen the class the way a real
member would. It does not: it moves the next field and contributes nothing
else.

**And the host was choosing the target's constants.** A floating literal is
read with the host's `strtold`, and the host is not the target: a `long double`
carries 64 bits of significand where gcc built this compiler and 53 where
clang did, so `long double x = 0.1L;` compiled for x86_64-linux was
`0xCCCCCCCCCCCCD000` from a Mac-built cxx1 and the correct
`0xCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD` from a Linux-built one. **Three-box verification cannot
see this**, and that is the interesting part: each box builds its own compiler
and each agrees with itself.

The question asked is now one the *digits* answer rather than the host: a
literal that is exactly a double is parsed identically by every host and
emitted identically by all three targets, and one that is not is refused where
the target's `long double` is wider than a double - which today is
x86_64-linux alone. `10^-k` divides out only through its fives, so the test is
integer arithmetic on the digit string and nothing else.

**This trades a capability for consistency, and says so.** A Linux-built cxx1
could spell `0.1L` exactly and no longer will. Approximating it differently
per build machine was the alternative, and a silent difference that only
appears when someone rebuilds elsewhere is worth less than a refusal that says
what is missing. Lifting it means converting decimal to binary in software,
which is its own step and is written down as one.

**Why there is no `.error` case for that refusal:** it fires for one target
and not the other two, and `run.sh` compiles for the host. A case that is
refused on the Linux box and accepted on the Mac would make the suite say
different things on different machines, which is the fault this fix exists to
remove. The positive half - the literals that are exact, and their emitted
bytes - is a case.

### A-05 and C-02, and a proxy that was true of every class the parser builds

**Apple's arm64 ABI ignores an empty class in the parameter list**, and
`sizeof` being 1 is not the question. cxx1 gave one a register and shifted
every argument after it along - consistent with itself, so only a mixed link
showed it. Measured with clang: `take(Empty, int x, int y)` puts x in w0, and
`take(Wrap, int x, int y)`, where Wrap's only member is an empty class, puts x
in w1. An empty *base* is ignored; a member is not.

**The first attempt asked `dataSize() == 0`**, which is true of every empty
class the parser lays out - and also of every type the compiler *synthesises*,
because nothing sets dataSize on those. A pointer to a member function is a
struct of one or two words built in `TypeTable`, so it answered 0 and was
passed in no register at all: `member-function-pointer` died with a bus error.
The member list is what actually says whether a class carries anything,
whoever built it, and that is what the test asks now. Worth remembering as a
shape: a field the parser fills in is not a property of the type system, and
the backends see both kinds.

**And every size here is a signed 32-bit count.** `static int a[600000000]`
overflowed one and was laid out anyway - `.zero -1894967296`, written into the
assembly by the shipped `-O2` binary without a word. The multiply is in
`long long` now, and an array this compiler cannot measure is refused where it
is written, by name, with the arithmetic done by division so the check itself
cannot overflow. The array length is read as `long long` rather than `long`
while the line is open, which is half of C-04: on the box where cl builds this
compiler a `long` is 32 bits, and `char a[0x100000001]` silently became
`char a[1]` there and kept its length on the other two.

**The sanitizer build is clean on the whole suite now**, where before it
reported this overflow - which is the point of having kept the control: the
same build still fails to report anything only because there is nothing left
to report.

### A-01 and A-04: the register `this` travels in, and the one x86 lacks

**cl passes `this` first and the hidden return pointer second; cxx1 passed
them the other way round.** For a free function returning a large struct the
pointer does come first, on every ABI - the Microsoft rule is about *member*
functions, and cxx1 reserved integer slot 0 for the pointer ahead of every
parameter including `this`. It did so on both sides of every call it
generated, so every case agreed with itself and disagreed with the platform.

Measured with clang for this ABI before anything was written:
`movq 56(%rsp), %rcx; leaq 32(%rsp), %rdx; call ?get@W@@QEAA?AUBig@@H@Z`, and
the callee reads its member through `%rcx` and writes its result through
`%rdx`. That is what cxx1 emits now, on both sides.

**The parser had to learn to say so.** A member call is lowered to an ordinary
one with the object's address in front, which is what makes everything below
it simple - and it is exactly the distinction the Microsoft ABI needs back.
`Call::hasThis` and `Function::hasThis` carry the one bit; `Signature::owner`
already knew the answer at every site that resolves an overload.

**`tools/windows/sret-check.cmd` is how it is proved**, and it is the shape
this class of bug needs: cxx1 compiles the member function, **cl compiles the
caller**, and they are linked and run. A same-compiler test cannot ask this
question - cxx1 was wrong in a way that was perfectly consistent with itself.
It sits beside `throw-check` and `catch-check` in the Windows leg of
`tools/verify-three`, and is the first thing in the fleet to check a calling
convention against the platform's own compiler rather than against a second
implementation of it.

**And `cvttsd2si` is a signed conversion, which is the only one x86 has.**
Below 2^63 that costs nothing; at or above it there is no signed answer and
the instruction returns the integer indefinite value, so
`(unsigned long long)12000000000000000000.0` came out 9223372036854775808 on
both x86 targets. arm64 has `fcvtzu` and was right all along - the house bug
class again, one target correct and two not. Subtract 2^63, convert what is
left, put the bit back; it is the mirror of the halving trick the other
direction already had, and it branches on `jae` rather than using `cmov`
because the Microsoft speller knows the one and not the other.

### A-02: a vtable slot is a use, and the Microsoft table names one fewer

**Emitting a table odr-uses everything in it.** The `used` flag came only
from calls, and a slot holding a function's address is not a call - so
`struct D : B { };` where B's destructor is virtual got a table pointing at
`~D` and no `~D` emitted anywhere. Nothing in the program named it and
nothing had to: `delete p` through a `B *` reaches it through the slot. The
link failed with a symbol not found, on a program rung 4 says works.

The slots are marked when the table is emitted, which is during the class's
own completion and well before `defineImplicitFunctions` walks the list.

**And then the same fault one symbol over, on one ABI.** Itanium has two
destructor slots - the complete-object form and the deleting one - so marking
the slots covers both. MSVC has a single slot holding the deleting destructor,
whose body calls an ordinary destructor that nothing else points at, so `??1E`
was still unemitted there and nowhere else. The class's own destructor is
marked alongside the slots now, and the Windows name comparison agrees on all
seventeen.

Worth the note because of how it was found: the fix looked complete, the Mac
and Linux suites were green, and it was the clang-as-MSVC name comparison that
said one ABI was still missing a symbol. That comparison runs on the Mac and
is the only thing in the fleet that would have caught it before the Windows
box did.

### S-09 and S-10: an object nobody set, and a default nobody asked for

**`P()` handed back the frame slot as it stood.** [dcl.init]/8 makes `T()`
value-initialisation, and for a class with no user-provided constructor that
is zero-initialisation. The comment in `classTemporary` read "an object with
nothing to set" - which is the wrong reading of a class that has no
constructor to *run*, and exactly why the zeroing is the compiler's job.
`f(P())` returned whatever the frame held, reproducibly and differently per
call site.

`initZero` already says this in statements, for a declaration; `zeroLeaves`
says it as an expression, which is the only form a `T()` in an expression can
take. The leaf walk is `initZero`'s and the access is `targetFor`'s, rooted at
a frame slot rather than at a declared name. The case dirties the frame first,
because on a clean stack the fault is invisible.

**Worth knowing about the case:** clang zeroes a nested temporary with a call
to `memset` where cxx1 writes the fields out. For a compiler that ships no
runtime that is the answer it has to give, and it is recorded rather than
matched.

**A default argument was dropped where it belonged and read where it did
not.** [dcl.fct.default]/4 lets a later declaration add a default the earlier
one did not give. The redeclaration path cleared the `noexcept` it had just
checked and left `pendingDefaults_` sitting in the parser, so `g`'s default
was lost - and then attached to the *next* function declared, which made `h()`
a legal call that evaluated g's token stream to fill it in. It returned 50.

The defaults are merged now rather than replaced, which is what the rule
actually says: what one declaration gave and the other did not is added, a
second default for the same parameter is refused by name, and the union has to
be a suffix even where neither half was on its own. Both halves are cases -
`g()` works, which it did not before either, and `h()` is refused.

### S-07 and S-08: the object during teardown, and two types

**A destructor never stored the vptr.** [class.cdtor]/4 says a virtual call
from a constructor or a destructor reaches the final overrider in *that*
function's class - the object is what the level currently running built, and
no more. Constructors stored the pointer as each level ran and destructors
did not, so on the way down the object still claimed to be the most derived
thing it had been: during `~A` a virtual call ran C's override, against
subobjects C had already finished destroying.

The fix is one condition. The store already existed and was already in the
right place - in front of the body, with the base's call wrapped around it -
and the test that reached it named only the constructor. A destructor gets it
now, and a three-level trace matches clang both for an automatic object and
through a base pointer.

**A comparison yielded `int`, which is C's answer.** [expr.rel]/1 and its
neighbours make it `bool`, and the difference is visible three ways: `sizeof`
was 4 where it is 1, overloading on `bool` against `int` chose the wrong
function, and `auto b = (x == y)` produced something that would hold 3. Four
sites, one word each. Nothing that used the old answer as a number had to
change, because a bool promotes to int wherever one is wanted.

**And [lex.icon] table 6 holds two ladders, not one.** A decimal literal with
no suffix climbs int, long, long long and never reaches an unsigned type; a
hexadecimal or octal one has an unsigned rung above each signed one. One
ladder served both, so `0x80000000` came out `long` where it is
`unsigned int` - which changes `sizeof`, and changes the signedness of any
comparison written against a mask: `0xFFFFFFFF == -1` was false where C++
makes it true. Which base a literal was written in now survives the lexer,
which is what the two ladders need to be told apart.

### S-06 and S-04, and a sixth site an audit of five missed

**Deleting a null pointer ran the destructor.** [expr.delete]/2 says it has no
effect; `operator delete` took null itself and always did, and what needed the
guard is the destructor call in front of it - and, for a virtual destructor,
the whole call, which loads the vtable through the pointer before it frees.
`delete p;` on a pointer that may be null is the reason `delete` gets written,
and it segfaulted. The guard is written `p != 0 ? (call, 1) : 0` rather than a
conditional with void arms: the value is thrown away either way, and an int on
both sides is a shape every backend already emits.

**A partial lane was written with the largest single instruction that fit.**
An aggregate whose size is not a multiple of eight ends in a lane of 3, 5, 6
or 7 live bytes, and every place one moved wrote two bytes for a three-byte
tail and four for a six - leaving the rest of the object as whatever the
destination held. `struct { char c[3]; }` passed by value arrived with its
last byte missing.

The tails are composed now, on arm64 by shifting the value register down (it
is dead after its own store at both sites) and on x86_64 by three helpers -
memory to memory, register to memory, memory to register. **The last of those
had to be written with no scratch register at all.** Building a value from the
bottom up needs one, because a 32-bit write zeroes the upper half of its
destination on this machine and an 8-byte read would read past the object; so
it goes from the top down, shifting the accumulator up a byte and OR-ing the
next one into its low eight bits, where an 8-bit write leaves the rest alone.

**Two things this cost, and both are worth writing down.** The first attempt
borrowed `%rcx` as a scratch and then kept reading the base address out of it,
which segfaulted on a three-byte struct - on the Linux box, and only there,
because the Mac's suite and both emit suites were green. `run.sh` runs the host
target only, so x86_64 code is executed on exactly one machine in the fleet and
`tools/verify-three` is the only thing that runs it.

And the audit named five sites; there are six. The one it missed is the
caller's load of an aggregate small enough to travel in registers - the most
ordinary case there is, `take(v)` with a `struct { char c[3]; }` - which was
found by bisecting sizes 1 to 15 on the box rather than by reading. Every size
in that range is a case now.

### S-03 and S-05, the two that made the object model quietly wrong

**A class may override a virtual of any base, and the slot search knew about
one.** `vtables_[cls]` is seeded from base zero alone, so a member overriding
a second base's virtual was found nowhere, was declared non-virtual, and a
call through a `B *` reached B's own function. Writing `virtual` set the flag
by hand and everything downstream worked - which is why the whole suite
passed, since every case in it writes the keyword, and why the two spellings
of one declaration meant different things.

[class.virtual]/2 does not care which base declared the function, so neither
does the search now: it looks through the bases after the first as well, and
what follows is unchanged from the path the keyword already took. The emitted
table is clang's, entry for entry - 56 bytes, `_ZThn8_N1D2fbEv` in the
secondary section - and the two spellings produce identical objects.

**Tail padding was reused for every base, and the ABI reuses it for some.**
Itanium sets dsize == sizeof for a POD and only lets a derived class into the
padding of a base that is *not* one; the Microsoft ABI never lets it in.
`struct TD : TP` with `TP { int; char; }` came out 8 bytes where all three
oracles say 12, and the cost is not the number: the base and the derived
member overlapped, so assigning through a `TP *` wrote over `TD::c`.

`podForLayout` is asked while the class is being completed, which is *before*
its implicit special members are declared - so what it sees is what the
program wrote, which is exactly the question the ABI asks. A vptr, a base, a
constructor or a destructor each answer no; the rest of the standard's list
cannot be written in this language yet, `operator=` being refused by name.

**Three existing cases printed a size that is an ABI's answer and not a
fact.** `vtable`, `tuple` and `template-dependent-base` each printed a
`sizeof` into one `.expected` shared by three machines, and the numbers were
Itanium's - so the Windows box failed all three the moment its layout became
correct. Each is a `static_assert` under `#ifdef _WIN32` now, with both
answers measured against clang for both ABIs: `Derived` 16 against 24,
`Tuple<int,char,double>` 16 against 24, `Deeper<double>` 24 against 32. That
is stronger than the print it replaced, because `emit.sh` checks it for all
three targets from whichever box is running, where a printed number is only
ever checked on the host.

**The empty base is the other half of the same rule and had to stay put.** An
empty class contributes nothing on every ABI - that is the empty base
optimisation, not tail padding - so the 0 is kept and only the non-empty case
consults the POD question. Seven layouts are pinned in
`tests/cases/base-tail-padding.cpp`, measured against clang for all three
ABIs, and the two that differ by ABI are written out under `#ifdef _WIN32`
rather than skipped: cl never reuses, so its `ND` is 12 where Itanium's is 8
and its `VD` is 24 where Itanium's is 16.

### C-01, and why the fix is at the two doors rather than at twelve

**`resolveOverload` handed back a reference into `functions_`.** That vector
grows whenever a function is declared, and the caller's next move is often to
parse something - a default argument, a conversion - that can declare one. The
reference was then reading freed memory, and so was `applyDefaults`, which
re-reads `f.params` and `f.name` on every turn of a loop whose body is a
parse.

Twelve call sites held that reference and a dozen more hold one straight out
of `functions_`. Editing twelve sites leaves the thirteenth, so **both entry
points hand back a copy now**: `resolveOverload` returns a `Signature` by
value, and `applyDefaults` takes one by value. Every existing
`const Signature &sig = resolveOverload(...)` binds to a temporary and is safe
without being touched, and the compiler found the one site that had taken the
*address* of the result - a base's constructor in a mem-initialiser list,
which now holds its own copy.

**The same bug was found once before**, in `localOwnerOf`'s caller, and fixed
there by taking a copy with a comment saying why. This is that comment applied
at the source instead of at one of its readers.

**It never crashed; it read whatever the reallocation left behind.** The
symptom was a diagnostic naming a function with no name and a parameter that
does not exist - `'' has no default for parameter 3`, for a function of two -
which is a freed `Signature` being printed. An ASan build reports
heap-use-after-free on the same input; the same build is clean on it now, and
on the whole 205-case suite. The negative control matters as much: that build
still reports C-02's signed overflow, so the instrumentation is live and the
clean result means something.

**And a second fault the case's linkage names exposed.** [dcl.fct.default]/5
reads a default argument in the scope of its *declaration*, and
`applyDefaults` already hides the caller's locals to honour that - but not the
enclosing function, so a lambda written in a default argument was given the
closure type of whichever function happened to call. clang names one written
at namespace scope `_ZNK3$_0clEi`; cxx1 wrote `_ZZ4mainENK3$_0clEi`. The
function is hidden and restored now alongside the locals, and both Itanium
targets agree with clang name for name. Windows keeps a recorded difference -
clang-msvc spells a namespace-scope closure `<lambda_0>` and encodes its
deduced return as `@` where cxx1 writes `$_0` and the deduced type - noted on
the case.

### What S-01 and S-02 were, and why they are one fix in two places

**The return path never called a copy constructor at all.** It moved the bytes
into the caller's storage and elided the *destructor* of the source to keep
the tally right - which is correct for exactly one case, an automatic object
of the function, where [class.copy]/31 also lets the copy itself go. For
anything else it left the caller holding a byte copy no constructor had made
and that the source would also destroy: `T pass(T t) { return t; }` built two
objects and destroyed three, and `return *p;` did the same. The standard
excludes a parameter from that elision *by name*, and the reason is exactly
this: the caller made the argument and the caller destroys it.

So `Local` knows whether it is a parameter now, and a return of a glvalue this
function does not own builds the copy into a slot of its own and elides
*that*. One constructor runs, its bytes become the caller's object, nothing
destroys it here - the copy the standard asks for plus the elision it allows,
which is what clang emits.

**The move-only half is the same shape one table over.** `copyConstructorOf`
answering null means two different things - a class that is trivially
copyable, and a class whose copy [class.copy]/7 *deleted* because it declared
a move constructor - and the byte path could not tell them apart. It asks
`moveConstructorOf` first now: with a move constructor in the way the
initialisation goes through overload resolution, which picks the move for an
xvalue; and an lvalue is refused by name, because the deletion is what the
reader needs to be told rather than a resolution failure that would name
something else.

**The cases pin the invariant, not the count.** CLAUDE.md rules out counting
constructor calls because clang elides at -O0 where cl does not, and that
rule is right - so `return-copy-balance.cpp` and `move-only.cpp` count
constructions and destructions and print whether the two agree. Elision moves
both numbers together and cannot change the answer; a double free is exactly
what makes them differ. That is the shape any future case about copies wants,
and it is why nothing in a 201-case suite noticed either bug.

## The line at C++14, and the refusals that hold it

**`src/` is C++14 and the language is C++11, and the risk runs the other way
round from the one that gets watched.** The build enforces the first: `-std=c++14
-pedantic` on three toolchains. Nothing enforced the second - the compiler
accepts what its rules accept, and a C++14 rule that slipped into one of them
would be found by a program that compiled here and nowhere else.

**Measured on 2026-09-01, with `clang++ -std=c++11 -pedantic-errors` as the
oracle for "this is not C++11": fifteen C++14 forms, one of them accepted.**
The one is worth the whole exercise:

```cpp
struct S { int i = 1; int j = 2; };
S s = {5, 6};                        // file scope
```

[dcl.init.aggr]/1 in C++11 makes a class that writes an initialiser on a
member *not an aggregate*, so this is ill-formed; C++14 removed that clause
and it means 5 and 6. cxx1 printed 5 and 6. **A local went to the constructor
path and was refused; a file-scope object is laid out by `flattenInit`, which
knows nothing about constructors** - so the one declaration that never asks
about a constructor was the one that needed to.

**Beside it, and found the same afternoon: a class with a constructor at file
scope never ran it.** `S s;` where `S::S` writes 7 read 0, and it compiled,
linked and ran. The local path refuses a `static` one by name for want of the
mechanism that runs it before main; the file-scope path had no test at all.
That is not a C++14 question - it is C++11 silently not happening - but it
lived in the same three lines and is refused by name now.

**Everything else held**, and one of them holds deliberately: a `constexpr`
non-static member function is implicitly `const` in C++11 and is not from
C++14, and cxx1 answers C++11 on both halves - it accepts the call on a const
object that C++14's clang refuses, and refuses the mutation that C++14's clang
accepts. `ParserType.cpp` says so where it sets the flag.

### A C++14 form has to be refused by name before its C++11 neighbour lands

The two places the line matters most were already named with the version
number in the message - `auto` as a parameter and `auto` as a return type.
The rest were refused only by a parse error, because the *C++11* feature next
to them does not parse either. **That is an accidental barrier, and it
disappears the moment the neighbour is built.** So each now says what it is
and which standard it belongs to:

| Written | Refused with |
| --- | --- |
| `0b101` | a binary literal is C++14 |
| `1'000` | a digit separator is C++14 |
| `decltype(auto)` | is C++14; `decltype` of an expression works |
| `[n = k]` | an init-capture is C++14 |
| `S s = {1, 2}` with an NSDMI | not an aggregate in C++11; C++14 changed that rule |
| `template <class T> T v = ...` | a variable template is C++14 |
| `[[noreturn]]`, `[[deprecated]]` | no attribute parses; C++11 has two, `[[deprecated]]` is C++14 |

The variable template is told from the two C++11 declarations by a token scan
rather than a parse: a class or a function reaches a `(` or a class key before
any `=`, and an out-of-line member writes a `::` before its own.

**The rule this leaves behind:** when a C++11 feature in that table's left-hand
column is built, the C++14 form beside it gets its named refusal in the same
commit. `S s{1, 2}` calling a constructor is the next one to meet it - it is
C++11, it is refused by name today as a missing feature, and the aggregate
rule beside it is a different answer to a nearly identical program.

## Three diagnostics that pointed the wrong way, and one name the assembler refused

**A `::` in an Itanium symbol, which never linked.** A class written inside a
function and handed to a function template came out `_Z1fI7main::LEiT_`: the
tag is `main::L` and the mangler spelled it whole, where [mangle] has a
`<local-name>` for exactly this - `Z <function> E <name>`, and clang writes
`_Z1fIZ4mainE1LEiT_`. The Microsoft ABI wraps the same thing in `?1?`, and
clang for that ABI writes `??$f@UL@?1??main@@9@@@YAHUL@?1??main@@9@@Z`. Both
are what cxx1 writes now, measured against clang for all three ABIs.

**The machinery was already there for a *member* of such a class** -
`itaniumLocalMemberName` and the Microsoft `scopeOf`'s `localOwner` - and what
was missing was the type being able to answer which function it was written
in. `Type::localOwner()` is that, set where the parser already computed it.

**Why no suite saw it.** `emit.sh` stops at assembly and the compiler exited
0, so a name the assembler refuses passes there; `run.sh` had no case with a
local class as a template argument; `names.sh` compares the cases that exist.
`tests/cases/local-class-template-arg.cpp` is that case now. Assembling every
emitted case would catch the class of fault - all 98 do assemble today - but
`emit.sh` is deliberately the suite that needs no assembler and runs anywhere,
so the case is the guard rather than a new step in it.

**Three messages that sent the reader somewhere false**, all found by writing
the program each one describes:

* `static_cast<int &>` of a const lvalue said `const_cast` "is not supported
  yet". It landed on 2026-08-30. The message now says what it says for
  `reinterpret_cast` - that the two are written separately on purpose.
* `A<int>::n` said "'A' is a class template, and instantiating one is not
  supported yet", while `A<int> a;` compiles. The instantiation is not the
  problem: reading a template-id as the qualifier of a name is, and
  `typedef A<int> AI;` then `AI::n` works today. The message says that.
* `auto f(int) -> int` said `auto` there "is C++14, and this compiler is
  C++11". **A trailing return type is C++11**, and it is not deduction at all -
  the reader wrote the type down. It is refused as the missing C++11 feature
  it is. The C++14 forms next to it, `auto f() { }` and `decltype(auto)`, keep
  their own answer. The arrow is found by stepping over the parameter list,
  which is still ahead at that point - it was recorded to be read again, not
  consumed.

And `README.md` documented `-target`, which the driver has never accepted; the
flag is `-arch`, as `tests/emit.sh` has always passed it.

## Rung 5: templates, done

**All of 5.1 to 5.7 landed 2026-08-29, each with its own section at the end of
this one.** What follows is the order the work was meant to happen in and the
reasons for that order, written before any of it: what follows is the order the work
is meant to happen in and the reasons for that order, written before any of
it, the way rungs 2 and 3 were.

Rung 5 is larger than rungs 2, 3 and 4 together. Rung 6 is where the three
targets stop being symmetric: Windows EH is SEH-based and needs unwind data,
`ml64` cannot emit CodeView, and arm64-darwin objects here carry no unwind
info. Expect Windows exceptions to lag, and do not promise otherwise.

### The decision everything else follows from: replay, not a dependent AST

A template is **instantiated by replaying its tokens with the parameters
bound**. All tokens are already in one vector and `replayInlineBodies` already
re-parses a body by moving `at_` - that is the same machinery, and it needs no
second AST and no second lookup pass.

**What it costs is two-phase lookup.** Every name in a template body is looked
up at instantiation, which is MSVC's historical model rather than the
standard's. The consequence is that **cxx1 accepts more than C++11 does**: a
non-dependent name declared *after* the template will bind here and be refused
by clang. That is over-acceptance, so it belongs in `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` when
it lands, not in a refusal.

The alternative - parsing each template body once into a dependent AST - is a
different compiler, and it would stall the ladder for a long time. The rewrite
risk that remains is confined to the template front end rather than the parser,
which is what makes the trade worth taking. **If templates ever feel wrong,
this is the decision to revisit first.**

### The order, and why it is that order

**5.1 - parameter lists, the `<` ambiguity, `>>`, and a template table. No
instantiation at all.** This is the rung's `const`: it changes how every
expression is parsed and everything else stands on it. `f<int>(x)` and
`a<b>(c)` are told apart only by knowing that `f` names a template, so the
table has to exist before anything reads a `<`. **Treat `<` as opening a
template-id only when the name is in that table** - never on shape alone, which
is the one mistake here that silently mis-parses code that used to work. `>>`
arrives from the lexer as a single token and has to split inside an argument
list without disturbing the shift operator.

**5.2 - function templates, explicit arguments only.** `twice<int>(x)` is a
complete and useful feature without deduction, and taking it first isolates the
mangler on the smallest case. All the Itanium template work lands here.

**5.3 - deduction.** `twice(1)`. Overload resolution then has to rank a
specialization against ordinary functions - a non-template wins a tie,
[over.match.best]. Kept separate from 5.2 so that when the matching algorithm
is being debugged it is the only new thing in the room.

**5.4 - class templates, explicit arguments.** One `Type` per argument list,
tagged `Box<int,3>`. Nested classes made this cheap rather than hard: `tag()`
is already an arbitrary qualified string with `localName()` and `enclosing()`
beside it, and both manglers already walk a scope.

**5.5 - out-of-line member definitions.** `template <class T, int N> int
Box<T,N>::size()`. The declarator already reads a multi-`::` qualifier for
nested classes; this is that path with a template-id in it.

**5.6 - explicit specialization**, `template <> struct Box<int,3>`, which is
simpler than partial specialization and which partial specialization needs.

**5.7 - partial specialization, then SFINAE, then variadic.** Each is its own
step and each is large. **Partial specialization has landed** - see its
section below. The other two are still unwritten and refused by name, and what
each will want is now clearer:

**SFINAE has landed** - see its section below. What it needed was a
substitution that can *fail* rather than refuse, and the line held exactly
where the plan said: a failure inside a signature, not inside a body.

**Variadic templates have landed too** - see the section below. The
prediction was right about what they would need and wrong about the size:
expansion turned out to be a lookup rather than a substitution, which made it
smaller than SFINAE.

**5.1 to 5.3 is the first shippable milestone**: function templates that
deduce, mangle correctly on all three targets, and link against clang's
objects. Re-plan from there. **Reached 2026-08-29** - see the three sections
at the end of this chapter for what each step turned out to mean.

### What both ABIs do, measured before any of it was written

    Itanium   _Z5twiceIdET_S0_          I...E, and the return type IS encoded
              _ZN3BoxIdLi2EE4sizeEv     Li2E for a non-type argument
    Microsoft ??$twice@N@@YANN@Z        ?? $ name @ args @@
              ?size@?$Box@N$01@@QEAAHXZ ?$Box@...@ is one scope component

Two things to take from that. **Itanium encodes a function template's return
type**, where an ordinary function's is absent - and it spells it `T_`, the
template *parameter*, not the argument it was given. So **a specialization is
mangled from the template's pattern plus its argument list, never from the
substituted signature**: the substituted one cannot say where a type came from.
And Microsoft's non-type argument `$01` is the `number()` helper already in
`src/Mangle.cpp` - value minus one as a digit - so that half is reuse.

### Refused by name until its own step

Default template arguments, template template parameters, member templates,
`typename` as a disambiguator, alias templates, explicit instantiation, and
parameter packs. Each with its own message. That discipline is what kept rungs
2 and 3 honest and there is more to refuse here than in either.

### Two things that will go wrong if they are not planned for

**An error inside a template body is reported at the instantiation**, which is
a line the reader did not write. Every diagnostic from a replayed body needs to
name both places, or the messages will be worse than useless.

**The Itanium substitution table and `I...E` interact**, and the interaction is
not guessable - the `S0_` in `_Z5twiceIdET_S0_` is a substitution of a template
*parameter reference*. Measure every case; do not reason about this one.

### 5.1 as it actually landed

**The table, the `<` ambiguity, `>>`, and nothing instantiated.** A template
declaration is read for its parameter list and its *name*, recorded in
`templates_`, and its definition is then stepped over unparsed. Every use of
the name is refused - by name, and after the argument list has been stepped
over, so the reader is told about the template rather than about a stray `<`.

**`>>` is split by a marker, not by inserting a token.** Every held body and
every template records an *absolute* index into the one token vector, so
inserting a second `>` would move all of them. `takeClosingAngle` takes the
first `>` by leaving `angleSplit_ = at_` behind without advancing, and the
second by advancing past the token. Tying it to the index rather than to a
flag is what lets a replay reaching the same `>>` again start over - which
matters from 5.2, where a body is replayed once per instantiation.

**`Box<Box<int>>` is the test, and the failure it guards against is not a
syntax error but the wrong message.** Without the split the inner list eats
both `>` and the outer one runs to the end of the file: the case's `.error`
holds the class-template refusal precisely because "this template argument
list is never closed" is what it says when the split is broken.

**A function template's name is read with the parameters bound to `int`.**
The name sits behind a return type and a declarator that mention them, so `T`
has to denote *something* before `T twice(T x)` can be read at all. The
stand-in cannot escape: the type built is discarded and the body is skipped.
A class template's name needs none of this - it is the identifier after
`struct`, read straight off, because parsing the body would register a class
that has no business existing until an argument list is given for it.

**Refused by name, each with its own message**: a template template
parameter, a default template argument, a parameter pack, `template <>`,
explicit instantiation, a member template, and both kinds of use. `typename`
is still refused everywhere except where 5.1 now reads it, in a parameter
list.

Suites 59 / 92 / 31; the C corpus is unchanged at 379/424.

### 5.2 as it actually landed

**A specialization is made by replaying the template's tokens with the
parameters bound**, and the binding is the whole trick: a type parameter is
entered as a *type name* and a non-type one as an *enumerator*. Those are the
two things this parser already knows how to look up, so `T x` and `int a[N]`
are read by the ordinary path with nothing taught about templates. The tables
are shadowed and put back, not cleared, because a template parameter may share
a name with something at file scope.

**A body cannot be written where the call is** - the call is in the middle of
another function - so a request is recorded and the definitions are replayed
after the file is read, to a fixed point. A body may ask for a specialization
of its own, which `quad` in `tests/cases/template-function.cpp` does. Same
shape as the implicit special members.

**The two ABIs are handed two different signatures, and that is not
cosmetic.** Itanium gets the template's *pattern* - `T twice(T)`, with
`Kind::TemplateParam` still in it - because its name spells `T_` where a type
came from a parameter, and the substituted signature has lost that. Microsoft
gets the *substituted* signature, which is what it writes. So the declaration
is read twice, once each way, and `Kind::TemplateParam` exists for no other
purpose: it has no size, no alignment and reaches no backend.

**The measured facts, all confirmed against cl as well as clang:**

    Itanium   _Z5twiceIiET_S0_    the return type IS encoded, and as T_
              _Z2f4IiEvT_S0_      void f4(T,T): the second T_ is S0_, not S_
              _Z4takeIiEvRKT_     the qualifier is asked about before the kind
              _Z3numILin11EEiv    a negative non-type argument
    Microsoft ??$twice@H@@YAHH@Z  the substituted return type, H not T_
              ??$negative@H$0?4@  -5 is $0 then '?' then number(5)
              ??$same@US@@@@YA?AUS@@U0@   the template-id's own tables

**The template name is Itanium substitution candidate zero.** That is what
makes the second `T_` in `void f4(T, T)` come out `S0_` rather than `S_`, and
nothing else written by that point could occupy the slot. Measured, because
reasoning about the substitution table is what CLAUDE.md already said not to
do.

**A Microsoft template-id carries back-reference tables of its own.** In
`??$same@US@@@@YA?AUS@@U0@` the parameter's name back-reference 0 is the `S`
the *return type* pushed - the `S` inside the argument list is invisible to
the signature. Both tables are put aside, used fresh, and put back.

**`>` stops being an operator inside an argument list**, and parentheses are
where it starts again - which is the whole reason C++ makes `f<(a > b)>` need
them. One flag, cleared in `primary`'s parenthesis branch.

**`tools/mangled-names` had been excluding every name beginning `??`** - so
every constructor, destructor, `operator=` and deleting destructor the
Microsoft ABI spells had never been compared by it. It was meant to exclude
only `??_C@`, the string literals. Narrowed when a file full of template
specializations came back as "0 names"; all 31 cases still passed afterwards,
so what it had not been checking was right anyway.

**Two pre-existing gaps turned up while probing and neither is about
templates**: `int()` as a value-initialised expression is not parsed at all,
and a definition may not leave a parameter unnamed. Both refuse by name.

Suites 63 / 98 / 33; the C corpus is unchanged.

### 5.3 as it actually landed

**Deduction reads the pattern, which 5.2 already had to build.** The
template's signature with `Kind::TemplateParam` still in it is walked beside
the argument types: a parameter reached in that walk binds, and anything else
has to be matched structurally. There is no table of "which positions are
dependent" because the type says so.

**A reference parameter looks through itself; everything else decays.**
`const T &` given an `int` deduces T as int, the const belonging to the
parameter and not to T. A non-reference parameter sees the argument decayed -
array to pointer, function to pointer, top-level qualifier gone - which is not
a rule deduction invented but what passing something already does.

**A parameter written out in full is not checked here.** Deduction only binds;
whether the argument can actually get there is overload resolution's question,
asked afterwards. Answering it twice would refuse conversions that are legal.

**Deduction failing is not an error.** A name may be both a template and an
ordinary function, and then a template that cannot be deduced is simply one
fewer candidate. It becomes the whole answer only where there is no ordinary
function of that name, and there the reason is worth printing - `'T' cannot be
worked out from this call: it is 'int' in one argument and 'double' in
another`, where clang needs two lines to say the same.

**A specialization is a candidate like any other and loses a tie.**
[over.match.best]. `resolveOverload` gained `betterCandidate`, which is the
comparison it already made plus one line: all conversions being equal, the
function that is not a specialization wins. Without it every call to a name
that is both is ambiguous, and deduction is what makes that the ordinary case
rather than a corner.

**So a specialization is registered under two keys** - `twice<int>`, which is
what the replayed definition declares, and `twice`, which is what resolution
has to see. And `declareFunction` skips a `fromTemplate` entry when matching,
since a specialization is never a redeclaration of an ordinary function.

**A candidate that loses gets no body.** It had to be instantiated before it
could be ranked, but only a specialization something *chose* is defined -
`Signature::used`, the same gate the implicit special members use. That is
what keeps the symbol list level with clang's, where a losing candidate was
never instantiated at all. Measured: a file where the ordinary function wins
has exactly clang's names, and the explicit-argument path had to be taught to
set `used` itself, since no ranking runs there.

**The milestone's own criterion was checked as a link, not a diff.** Two
files including one header of templates, one compiled by cxx1 and one by
clang, linked both ways round, print what the all-clang build prints. A
mangled name can be diffed; that a specialization is *called* correctly has to
be run. Note what makes it link at all: cxx1 emits a specialization as a
strong symbol where clang's is a comdat, so the linker keeps cxx1's and there
is no duplicate - the same divergence `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` records for inline
members, working in this direction by luck rather than by design.

Suites 66 / 104 / 35; the C corpus is unchanged.

### 5.4 as it actually landed

**The plan said nested classes would make this cheap and they did.** A
specialization is an ordinary class whose tag is `Box<int,3>` - and `tag()`
was already an arbitrary qualified string with `localName()` and
`enclosing()` beside it, so every table keyed by the tag needed nothing. The
class path was told one thing: what tag to take. `structOrUnionSpecifier` runs
unchanged over the template's own tokens with the arguments bound, exactly as
a function specialization replays its definition.

**A specialization carries its name and arguments on the `Type`**, because
neither ABI spells the tag: Itanium wants `3BoxIiLi3EE` and Microsoft
`?$Box@H$02@`. `Kind::TemplateParam` and `TemplateArg` are what those two are
built from, and `TemplateArg` moved into `Type.h` for it.

**The measured mangling, cl and clang agreeing:**

    Itanium   _ZN3BoxIiLi3EE4sizeEv        the template-id is a prefix component
              _Z3two6HolderIiES_IdE        the template NAME is a candidate of
                                           its own - the S_ there is the word
              _Z4same6HolderIiES0_         and the whole type is the next one
              _Z6nested6HolderIS_IiEE      both, in one name
    Microsoft ?size@?$Box@H$02@@QEAAHXZ    one scope component
              ?copyFrom@?$Holder@H@@QEAAXAEBU1@@Z   pushed as one name
              ?withClass@@YAXU?$Holder@US@@@@US@@@Z the id's own tables again

**So the Itanium table holds two kinds of candidate**, a type or a template's
name, and `Sub` says which. Getting this wrong is invisible until two
specializations of one template meet in a signature.

**The injected class name is what made the bodies work.** Inside `Holder`'s
own body the word `Holder` means this specialization - `const Holder &` and a
`Holder *` return type both need it. Registered as a member type name,
`Holder<int>::Holder`, so the walk a nested class already needs finds it. Two
places had to be taught separately: from inside the body through
`classStack_`, and **from a replayed body's return type through
`inlineOwner_`** - a held body is replayed at file scope and its return type
is read before the declarator says which class it belongs to, so
`currentClass_` is not set yet. `Holder *self()` failed while
`copyFrom(const Holder &)` worked, which is what pointed at it.

**A specialization's constructor has two spellings and both are needed.** The
source writes `Holder(`; the table keys it `Holder<int>::Holder<int>`, because
that is what `constructorKey` makes of the tag. `PendingBody` carries the
source name beside the tag, and only the name that *is* the class moves.

**Member bodies are not replayed where the class is made.** Instantiating a
class happens in the middle of whatever asked for it - which may be a
declaration inside a function - and a replay goes through `topLevel`, which
clears that function's locals. They are handed back and replayed by the same
fixed-point pass that defines function specializations.

**And only the members something calls.** clang and cl both instantiate a
member function of a class template on use, so emitting the rest puts symbols
in the object that neither oracle has - measured, one unused member was one
extra name on all three targets. `PendingBody` carries the function table's
key and the gate is `Signature::used` again. A body skipped on one pass may be
wanted after another is replayed, which is what the outer loop is for.

**Reading a pattern must not instantiate a class.** `Holder<T>` has a member
of type T, which has no size. `patternOnly_` answers a shallow type instead,
carrying the name and the arguments and nothing else - which is all either
caller reads, since the mangler spells those and deduction compares them.

Suites 68 / 110 / 37; the C corpus is unchanged.

### 5.5 as it actually landed

**The plan called this "the qualified-name path with a template-id in it" and
that is exactly what it was.** One place in the declarator had to learn that
the name it just read may be a class template, in which case what follows is
an argument list and the class it makes is the qualifier. Everything after the
`::` is read by the loop nested classes already needed. That one insertion is
the whole feature at the parse end.

**Finding it took a wrong turn worth recording.** The read that learns what a
`template <...>` declares used to bind the parameters to `int`, which was
enough to find a name - but `Box<T>::size` was then read as a declaration
*named* `Box`, because the declarator stopped at the `<` it could not use. The
symptom was silent: everything compiled and the definitions simply never
appeared, and the link failed with six undefined members. The read binds the
parameters to themselves now, which also stops a name scan instantiating
`Box<int>` for a declaration that asks for no class at all.

**An out-of-line definition belongs to the class template, not to a template
of its own.** The member was declared in the class body; this is only where
its definition happens to be written. So it is kept on the `TemplateDecl` and
replayed when a specialization needs it - **and the list is re-read on every
pass**, because a definition may be written further down the file than the use
that asked for the class. `tests/cases/template-out-of-line.cpp` puts one
after `main` on purpose.

**Replayed through `topLevel`, not `replayInlineBodies`.** The tokens already
say `Box<T>::get`, so with the parameters bound the ordinary member-definition
path reads the qualifier itself. `inlineOwner_` exists to supply a qualifier
the source does not have, and here the source has one.

**Refused by name: a constructor or destructor written outside the class.** A
member function has a return type, which is what gets the declarator started;
a constructor has none, and the ordinary path for that - `atUntypedMemberDefinition`
- looks for `Name ::` and not for a template-id. Its own step.

Suites 70 / 113 / 38; the C corpus is unchanged.

### 5.6 as it actually landed

**Nothing about the class path changed, which is the point.** The tag is
`Name<int>` exactly as it would be if the template had produced it, so every
use finds this one through the same lookup, both manglers spell it the same
way, and its members are keyed the same. What differs is only where the body
came from - which is why a specialization may have members the template does
not.

**The argument list is read against the primary's parameters.** That is what
decides whether an argument is a type or a value, the same rule every other
use follows, and the reason the primary has to be declared first.

**Too late is an error about placement, not a redefinition.** [temp.expl.spec]
wants the specialization before the first use that would instantiate, and if
one already did then two different classes have been given one name. The
existing tag lookup is what catches it, and the message says where to move the
specialization rather than that something is defined twice.

**A written class emits its inline members; an instantiated one emits the
members something calls.** Two rules, and they are not an inconsistency: 5.4
gates an *implicit* instantiation because clang and cl instantiate a member
only on use, while a class written out - ordinary or explicitly specialized -
goes down the path every class has always taken. An explicit specialization
behaves like the class it is. Measured: an unused member of one leaves the
same extra symbol an unused member of a plain class does, which is the
divergence `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` already records for inline members.

**Refused by name: an explicit specialization of a function template.** A
class one is a class definition, which the class path already reads. A
function one has to be mangled from the *primary's* pattern - `_Z5twiceIiET_S0_`
is built from `T twice(T)` plus the arguments, and this declaration is not
that - so it cannot be read as an ordinary definition. Its own step.

Suites 73 / 116 / 39; the C corpus is unchanged.

### 5.7a as it actually landed: partial specialization

**The pieces were already here, which is why this was the smallest step of
the rung.** The pattern read gives a template's arguments with
`Kind::TemplateParam` still in them, and matching a pattern against a real
type is a walk `deduceOne` already did. What is new is that the walk here is
**[temp.deduct.type] rather than [temp.deduct.call]**: `matchPattern` decays
nothing and forgives nothing - a pattern that is a pointer matches a pointer
and nothing else, because there is no conversion here for a mismatch to be
excused by. Deduction from a call is deliberately looser and stays that way.

**The qualifier is asked about before anything else and both sides must
agree.** `What<const T>` matches `What<const int>` with T as int and does not
match `What<int>`; `What<T>` matches both, binding T to the qualified type
where there is one. That ordering is the whole rule.

**The tag never changes.** `What<int *>` is that whether the body came from
the template or from a pattern that matched it, so the mangling and every
lookup are what rung 5.4 left them.

**[temp.class.order] asked the standard's own way**, by matching each pattern
against the other: A is at least as specialized as B when B's pattern matches
A's, with A's parameters standing as opaque types - which is what
`Kind::TemplateParam` already is.

**"Was not beaten" is not the same as "beats", and the difference is a silent
wrong answer.** `P<A, int>` and `P<int, B>` given `P<int, int>` match neither
each other, so neither is more specialized and the program is ambiguous.
Checking only whether the winner had been beaten let that through and picked
whichever was written first. The winner must beat every other candidate.

**Refused by name**: a partial specialization with a parameter its arguments
never mention (nothing could ever work it out), one with no body, and one of
something that is not a class template.

### Two bugs this step found, and neither was about templates

**A class with member functions and no data members lost all of them.** The
empty-class rule - size 1, so two objects have different addresses - returned
from the middle of the class body, before the held member bodies were
replayed, before the implicit special members were declared, and before a
vtable would have been emitted. Calling a member of such a class compiled and
linked to nothing. It had shipped since member functions arrived, because no
case had a class carrying behaviour and no state. Found from the far end: a
class template with two type parameters would not link, and an empty class is
what it happened to be. The rule changes the numbers now and nothing else.

**A const template argument was dropped from the Microsoft name.** Measured
with cl: `W<const int>` is `?f@?$W@$$CBH@@QEAAHXZ`, and `$$CB` is written only
where the thing under the const is not a pointer - `const int *` is `PEBH` and
`int *const` is `QEAH`, the P becoming a Q, which type() already wrote. cxx1
dropped it, so `W<const int>` and `W<int>` shared one symbol: two different
classes, one name, and whichever body was emitted answered for both. Silent,
and only on Windows. Itanium spells it with a K and always had.

Suites 78 / 125 / 42; the C corpus is unchanged.

### 5.7b as it actually landed: SFINAE

**[temp.deduct]/8 is the one place in this compiler where a failure
recovers.** A trial is a stretch of parsing whose failure is an answer:
`Source::fail` throws inside one instead of printing and exiting, and the
candidate that was being formed is dropped. Everywhere else the rule stands -
errors at the point of interception, and nothing recovers. Making that the
*only* exception is what keeps the two disciplines from bleeding into each
other.

**A trial has to put back everything a half-formed signature touched**: the
token position, the class stack, the pattern flag, and above all the bound
parameter names, or the next candidate reads a table that still says T means
int. That last one is an RAII guard inside `readTemplateDeclaration` rather
than a `catch`, because it must also run on the ordinary path.

**Three things had to exist first, and none of them is SFINAE:**

- **A typedef inside a class.** Keyed "S::value", which is the qualified key a
  nested class already uses, so every lookup that finds a nested class finds
  this too.
- **`Value<T>::type` as a type**, which is the `Outer::Inner` walk with a
  class that was made rather than named in front of it. And `T::type`, which
  the old walk could not spell at all: it built the key by joining strings,
  where the first component here is a typedef *for* a class rather than its
  tag.
- **`typename` read and dropped.** It tells a C++ parser that a dependent
  qualified name is a type, which matters only where a template body is parsed
  before its arguments are known - and this one replays a body at
  instantiation. Accepted rather than refused so that a file written for clang
  compiles here too, which is what the whole oracle method rests on.

**`Kind::DependentMember` exists because Itanium spells the pattern.**
`_Z4takeIiEN5ValueIT_E4typeES1_` says `Value<T>::type` where the substituted
signature says int and has forgotten where it came from. `NT_4typeE` is the
other shape. Microsoft needs none of it - it writes the substituted signature
and always did. Measured on both.

**Where it stops is a mangling wall, not a parsing one.** A signature that
depends on its parameters through an *expression* - `enable_if<sizeof(T) == 4,
int>::type` - is spelled by Itanium as the expression itself,
`N9enable_ifIXeqstT_Li4EEiE4typeE`. Nothing here can write that, so it is
refused where it is written. Mangling from the substituted signature instead
would compile and run correctly and produce a name no other compiler agrees
with, and a name that links with nothing is worse than a refusal that says
why.

**Two more silent bugs closed on the way, and neither is about SFINAE.**

`templates_` holds one entry per name, so a second template of that name
replaced nothing and simply disappeared - a missing overload with no
diagnostic. Refused by name now. Overloading function templates is its own
step, and it is what would let SFINAE choose between two templates rather than
between a template and an ordinary function.

**And an empty class passed by value took a register it should not have, and
crashed on one target only.** The SysV eightbyte lanes started out SSE and
only a non-floating member cleared one, which says nothing about a lane no
member covers - an empty class kept them all, went in xmm0 through a `movss`
reading four bytes of a one-byte object, and segfaulted on the Linux box.
arm64 and Windows classify differently and were unaffected: the house bug
class, found by a case that only reached it because a class with a typedef and
no data is exactly what SFINAE is written with. clang settles it -
`take2(E{}, 7)` puts the 7 in `%edi`, so the class consumed nothing - and the
fix is an empty lane list, which every loop that walks lanes already treats as
nothing to move. **Checked by a link**: objects cxx1 compiled link with g++'s
in both directions and print what the all-g++ build prints, including the case
with the empty class sitting between other arguments.

Suites 83 / 134 / 45; the C corpus is unchanged.

### 5.7c as it actually landed: variadic templates

**A pack is bound to a list of types, not to a type**, which is the one thing
`Kind::TemplateParam` could not say. Nothing may write `Ts` on its own; what
reads a pack is `Ts...`, `rest...` and `sizeof...`, and all three want the
list. It is shadowed and restored like every other binding, in a table of its
own.

**`Ts... rest` is one thing written and several parameters made, and which
one depends on who is reading.** In a *pattern* it is one parameter of type
`Ts...` - Itanium spells that `DpT0_` and says the same thing at every size,
which is exactly what lets one pattern serve every specialization. In a real
instantiation it is as many parameters as the pack has members, named
`rest$0`, `rest$1`.

**So expansion is a lookup, not a substitution.** `rest...` at a call is the
names those parameters were given, looked up like any other identifier -
whatever `rest$0` holds now is what goes in. That is why this step was
smaller than SFINAE rather than larger, which the plan had it the other way
round.

**The measured mangling, and the two ABIs disagree about shape as usual:**

    Itanium   _Z7nothingIJicEEiv        a pack argument is J...E
              _Z5totalIiJEEiT_DpT0_     an empty one is JE, and the parameter
                                        is still Dp whatever the size
    Microsoft ??$total@HH@@YAHHH@Z      members listed inline, nothing around
              ??$total@H$$V@@YAHH@Z     and $$V for an empty pack

**Refused by name, each its own step**: a non-type pack (binding one is
binding a list of *types*, and a list of values needs a second list beside it
and a second expansion), expanding a pack into another template's argument
list, and a parameter written after a pack.

Suites 87 / 137 / 46; the C corpus is unchanged.

## Rung 6: exceptions - the plan it was built to, kept as written

**6.1 has landed and has its own section below.** What follows is the order
the rest is meant to happen in, written before any of it.

**The asymmetry the rung-5 plan warned about is real, and the first surprise
is that it runs the other way.** The MASM backend has emitted Microsoft's
unwind data since it was written - `PROC FRAME`, `.PUSHREG`, `.SETFRAME`,
`.ALLOCSTACK`, `.ENDPROLOG`, which ml64 turns into `.pdata` and `.xdata` - so
**Windows frames were already unwindable and the two Itanium targets were
not**. Windows will still lag on the *tables*, which are MSVC's own format,
but not on the frames.

**6.1 - unwind data on the Itanium targets.** Nothing else in the rung can be
tested without it, and it is worth having on its own: a debugger could not
walk out of a cxx1 frame either.

**6.2 has landed** - see its section below. The prediction held exactly: the
type_info pointer was the whole of the work.

**6.3 has landed** - see its section below. It was the largest step, and all
three of its bugs were silent.

**6.4 has landed** - see its section below. The prediction was right: `alive_`
was the whole of the bookkeeping, and what was new was where the code runs
from.

**6.5 - Windows.** `__CxxFrameHandler4` and MSVC's own tables, which are a
different design from the Itanium one rather than a different spelling of it.
**Its first half - `throw` - has landed; see the section below.** What is left
is `try`/`catch`, planned in detail here from cl's own output and not started.

### 6.5b: what cl emits for one try/catch, measured

    main            PROC                  - no FRAME. cl writes its own
                                            unwind data rather than letting
                                            the assembler do it
    $pdata$main     DD imagerel $LN9      - start, end, and the unwind info
    $unwind$main    DD 010419H, 06204H    - the prologue codes, then
                    DD imagerel __CxxFrameHandler4
                    DD imagerel $cppxdata$main
    $cppxdata$main  DB 018H + three imagerel pointers
    $stateUnwindMap$main, $tryMap$main, $handlerMap$main, $ip2state$main
    main$catch$0    PROC in segment text$x - the handler, a function of its own

**The first finding decides the shape of the work: `PROC FRAME` cannot be
used for a function with a handler.** MASM's `PROC FRAME:handler` emits the
handler's address, and the *handler data* - the pointer to the FuncInfo -
goes immediately after it in the same UNWIND_INFO, where no MASM directive
can reach. cl does not use `PROC FRAME` at all here; it writes `$pdata$` and
`$unwind$` by hand. **So cxx1 has to do the same for any function with a
`try`**, which means teaching the Windows backend to emit unwind codes itself
rather than through `.PUSHREG` and `.ALLOCSTACK`. That is a real change to a
part that has worked since it was written, and it is the first step.

**A handler is a funclet - a separate function.** `main$catch$0` lives in
`text$x`, takes the parent's frame pointer in `rdx`, saves it, addresses the
caught object relative to it, and *returns the address to continue at* in
`rax`. Nothing in cxx1's code generator makes a second function out of a
block today, and the funclet must see the parent's frame slots at the offsets
the parent gave them.

**Use `__CxxFrameHandler3`, not 4.** cl defaults to 4, whose tables are a
*compressed* encoding - the `DB 04H, 08H, 010H` above is a variable-length
format rather than a struct. FH3 is still supported by the runtime and its
FuncInfo is the classic documented layout of fixed-width fields. Emitting FH3
is the difference between writing a struct and writing a compressor.

**In order, then:**

1. **Done.** Hand-written `.pdata`/`.xdata`, and for *every* function rather
   than only the ones with a handler - one path, exercised by the whole suite,
   rather than a second one that only the new feature walks. See below.
2. One funclet per handler, with the parent frame arriving in `rdx`.
3. The FH3 tables - UnwindMapEntry, TryBlockMapEntry, HandlerType,
   IPtoStateMap - and the state variable in the parent's frame that the
   runtime reads through `dispUnwindHelp`.
4. Cleanups, which are funclets too, and are what let 6.4's destructors run
   on this target.

Expect this to lag and do not promise otherwise.

### 6.5b steps 2 and 3: the FH3 tables, decoded from cl

Measured with `cl /EHsc /d2FH4-`, which is how to ask for the older handler -
cl defaults to `__CxxFrameHandler4` and its compressed encoding. What follows
is the whole of what one `try { risky(1); } catch (int e) { ... }` needs.

    $cppxdata$main  DD 019930522H            the magic number
                    DD 02H                   maxState
                    DD imagerel $stateUnwindMap$main
                    DD 01H                   nTryBlocks
                    DD imagerel $tryMap$main
                    DD 06H                   nIPMapEntries
                    DD imagerel $ip2state$main
                    DD 028H                  dispUnwindHelp
                    DD 00H                   pESTypeList
                    DD 01H                   EHFlags

    $stateUnwindMap DD -1, 0   twice         toState and action, per state
    $tryMap         DD 0, 0, 1, 1            tryLow, tryHigh, catchHigh,
                    DD imagerel $handlerMap$0$main        nCatches
    $handlerMap     DD 00H                   adjectives
                    DD imagerel ??_R0H@8     the type caught
                    DD 020H                  dispCatchObj - where in the frame
                    DD imagerel main$catch$0 the funclet
                    DD 038H                  dispFrame
    $ip2state       DD imagerel main,   -1   six pairs: an address and the
                    DD imagerel main+13, 0   state in force from it, covering
                    DD imagerel main+24, -1  the funclet as well as the body
                    DD imagerel main$catch$0,    0
                    DD imagerel main$catch$0+13, 1
                    DD imagerel main$catch$0+29, 0

**Three things in that are code, not tables.** The parent writes `-2` into the
unwind-help slot at `dispUnwindHelp` on entry - cl emits
`mov QWORD PTR $T2[rsp], -2` as its first instruction. The `ip2state` map
needs a label at every point where the state changes, which the code
generator has to place. And the funclet's own unwind info names
`__CxxFrameHandler3` and *the parent's* `$cppxdata$` - the two share one
FuncInfo.

**The offsets are frame-relative, and cl's example is rsp-relative because
that function has no frame pointer.** cxx1 always establishes rbp, so
`dispUnwindHelp`, `dispCatchObj` and `dispFrame` have to be measured from
whatever the unwind info calls the frame base - which for cxx1 is rbp with
`UWOP_SET_FPREG`. That is the part most likely to be wrong first.

**The funclet itself** (measured in step 2's listing): a `PROC` in `text$x`
that saves `rdx` - the parent's frame pointer - into its own shadow space,
sets `rbp` from it, runs the handler, and returns the address to continue at
in `rax`. Because cxx1 addresses every local as `[rbp-N]`, a handler body
compiles inside a funclet exactly as it would inline, which is the one thing
about this that is easier here than it looks.

### 6.5b: the Windows frame now has its base at the bottom

**Done, and it stands on its own.** The prologue on this target is
`push rbp; sub rsp,N; mov rbp,rsp` rather than Itanium's
`push rbp; mov rbp,rsp; sub rsp,N`, so **rbp is the establisher frame** the
Microsoft runtime hands a handler, and every local is a *positive*
displacement from it - which is the only thing an FH3 table can express. The
epilogue gives the allocation back by hand, since there is no longer a saved
rsp in rbp to restore from.

**The whole frame moved by one constant, so the translation is one line, in
one place.** Every frame operand in the code generator is written against rbp
as Itanium establishes it, and this target's rbp is exactly `frameSize` lower
- so `[rbp + d]` becomes `[rbp + d + frameSize]` when an operand is
*rendered*, positive displacements included: an incoming stack argument is
above the old rbp and above the new one by the same amount plus the frame.

**That is not where it was tried first.** Rewriting the call sites looked
tidier and was wrong: `mem(-(slot), "%rbp")` is one of at least half a dozen
shapes the generator builds a frame operand in - `mem(off - slot, ...)`,
`mem(-n.resultSlot(), ...)`, `mem(to, ...)` with `to` precomputed - and
catching fifteen of them left the rest addressing a frame that had moved. The
suite said so immediately: **eight Windows cases failed with wrong values and
no crash**, which is what a stack slot read one frame away looks like. One
choke point at the renderer catches every shape by construction.

### 6.5b step 4: cleanups, and rung 6.5 with it

**`cleanup.cpp` runs on all three targets now** - its `.notarget` is gone.
Destructors run as an exception passes through a Windows frame, which is what
makes RAII mean anything there.

**A cleanup is a *state*, not a try block.** Nothing is caught: the runtime
runs some destructors and carries on. It is told so with one state per region
whose *action* is a funclet and whose `toState` is the region before it, so
unwinding walks the chain backwards one object at a time.

**Each funclet destroys only what its own region built**, and that is the
difference from the Itanium pad rather than a detail. The Itanium pad
*resumes* - it does not chain - so it destroys everything alive at that point.
Copying that shape here would destroy the earlier objects once per region.

**The `.pdata` has to be sorted, and funclets break the order.** A `.pdata`
contribution is sorted by the address it describes; every funclet lives in
`.text$x`, which the linker lays after `.text`, so all of them come after all
of the ordinary functions. Emitting each funclet's entry beside its parent
interleaves the two orders and the linker says **LNK1223: invalid .pdata
contributions** - which is what it said as soon as more than one function had
a funclet, and cleanups made that the common case. They go to
`MasmSpelling::trailer_` and are written after everything else.

**A cleanup funclet returns nothing.** A handler hands back the address to
carry on at; a cleanup has nowhere to carry on *to*, the runtime going on
unwinding once it returns.

**`tools/mangled-names` asks clang with `-fexceptions` on Windows now**, which
it could not while cxx1 had no tables for that target. What made the
comparison possible was dropping the **funclet names from both sides**: this
compiler writes `main$catch$0` and cl writes `?catch$1@?0?main@4HA` and
`?dtor$2@...`, and those are *file-local* symbols nothing links against - a
difference between the two spellings is a naming style rather than an ABI
fault, and whether the handlers work is what `catch-check` and the run suite
answer. Every name that crosses an object boundary is still compared, and on
this target that is now done for cases with exceptions in them for the first
time.

### 6.5b steps 2 and 3: done - cxx1 catches on Windows

**`catch-check.cmd` prints `before / caught 7 / after`**, and it runs inside
`verify-three` beside the throw check. That one has cl catch what cxx1 threw
and says nothing about this frame; this compiles both halves with cxx1, so
what it tests is the funclet, the FH3 tables and the unwind data together.

**Two faults stood between the tables being right and this working, and
neither was in the tables.**

**`text$x` is a segment called text.** The funclet's segment was written the
way cl's listing writes it, undotted, and the linker gave it a section of its
own with data attributes - so the runtime found the handler, called it
correctly, and faulted on the first instruction because the page was not
code. **It reads exactly like a dispatch fault and is not one.** `.text$x`
with `ALIGN(16) 'CODE'` is what assembles. This is the *third* time cl's
listing has recorded what cl means rather than something that assembles -
`.pdata` and `.xdata` were the first two, in step 1.

**rsp is restored from rbp, never by adding to itself.** Once the handler ran,
`after` printed and the program then jumped to `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE`. That is
-2, the unwind-help sentinel: `ret` had taken it as a return address. Resuming
after a catch is the case that decides this - the runtime unwinds the frame
and jumps back into the middle of the function, and **rsp is whatever it left
there** rather than what the body had, so `add rsp, frameSize` lands
somewhere arbitrary. `lea rsp, [rbp + frameSize]` is right, and it is written
as an offset of zero because this target's renderer adds the frame size to
every rbp displacement.

**How they were found, with no debugger on the box.** A vectored exception
handler in a cl-compiled translation unit, installed before the throw, printing
the exception code, the faulting address and the RVA. It showed the C++ throw
going out (`E06D7363`) and then where the access violation landed - and an RVA
matched against `dumpbin /headers` named the section, which was the whole
answer. `AddVectoredExceptionHandler` is worth reaching for before installing
debugging tools.

**Several `try` statements in one function work**, which the first version did
not: it wrote tables for `msTries()[0]` and nothing else, so the second try in
a function had no tables and the program died with no output at all. Try *k*
owns states 2k and 2k+1 - the body and its handlers - and `maxState` is twice
the count. They are numbered rather than nested because the parser refuses a
`try` inside another; a nested one would want `tryLow` and `tryHigh` to span
its child's states, which is what those two fields are for.

**What is still refused, and why it is not a small thing.** `return` inside a
`catch`: a handler is a function of its own there, so leaving one early is not
a jump but a *return* of the address to carry on at - in the register a return
value would travel in. `try-catch.cpp` ends every handler with one and so
still names this target in its `.notarget`; `try-catch-value.cpp` is the same
feature with handlers that fall off their end and runs on all three.

**`tools/mangled-names` still asks clang with `-fno-exceptions` for Windows,
and step 4 is what changes it.** `-fexceptions` was tried now that cxx1 can
catch: fourteen cases differ, and every difference is a `?dtor$N@...` funclet -
clang runs a destructor during unwinding by compiling it into a cleanup
funclet, and cxx1 emits no cleanups on this target. That is a missing feature
rather than a wrong name, and asking for it would report the same absence
fourteen times.

### 6.5b steps 2 and 3, as they stood while stuck

**Superseded in part** - the frame fault described below is fixed; what
follows is what has been eliminated since, and what has not.

**Still failing:** a throw dies at **0xC0000005** rather than reaching the
handler. It faults with an *empty* handler too, so it is dispatch and not the
handler's body. What has been ruled out: the frame shape (above); the funclet
prologue, which is now byte-for-byte cl's shape - `mov [rsp+16],rdx; push rbp;
sub rsp,32; mov rbp,rdx`, cl included; the funclet's own unwind codes, where
`032H` for a 32-byte allocation had been written `042H`; and `dispFrame`,
tried at both `frameSize` and 0 with no change.

**What has not been examined** is the ip2state map, which is where the next
attempt should start: cl writes **six** entries for one try where this writes
four, and three of cl's six describe the funclet at states 0, 1, 0 rather than
the single row this writes. A debugger on the box is the way in - reasoning
from listings has now returned four wrong answers in a row.



**What works on the Windows box.** Handler funclets are emitted in `text$x`
with unwind data of their own naming `__CxxFrameHandler3` and the parent's
FuncInfo; the parent's UNWIND_INFO carries the handler flags and the FuncInfo
pointer; and the four FH3 tables are written. It assembles, links, and **a
`try` that does not throw runs correctly** - `before / no throw / after`,
exit 0. So the shape is right and nothing about it disturbs the ordinary path.

**A throw dies at 0xC0000409**, and the cause is measured rather than
suspected. It is the thing the plan said would be wrong first.

**Where the establisher frame is, when there is a frame register.** Windows
computes it as `rbp - FrameOffset*16`, and every `disp` in the FuncInfo -
`dispUnwindHelp`, `dispCatchObj` - is a *positive* offset up from there.
Measured twice with cl:

| | cl, no frame pointer | cl, `_alloca` forces one | cxx1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prologue | `sub rsp,56` | `push rbp; sub rsp,64; lea rbp,[rsp+32]` | `push rbp; mov rbp,rsp; sub rsp,N` |
| FrameOffset | none | 2, so `rbp = rsp_after + 32` | 0 |
| establisher | `rsp_after` | `rbp - 32` = `rsp_after` | **`rbp - 0` = `rbp`** |
| a local | `$T2` at `[rsp+40]` | `$T2` at `[rbp+16]` | at `[rbp-k]` |
| its disp | 40 | 48 = 16 + 32 | **-k** |

**cl's locals are above the establisher and cxx1's are below it.** cxx1 takes
`rbp` *before* allocating the frame, so every local is at a negative offset
from the establisher and a FuncInfo cannot say so - the fields are unsigned
displacements. `disp = frameSize - slot`, which is what is emitted now,
describes a frame this compiler does not build.

**The fix is a change to the Windows frame, not to the tables.** The prologue
has to become `push rbp; sub rsp,N; mov rbp,rsp`, so that `rbp` *is* the
establisher and FrameOffset stays 0 honestly; and every local on that target
then has to be addressed `[rbp + (frameSize - slot)]` rather than `[rbp -
slot]`. That is one change in the prologue and one in how the Windows backend
spells a frame slot, and it touches every function on the target rather than
only the ones with a `try` - so it wants the whole suite behind it, which is
the same argument step 1 made for writing unwind data for every function.

**`try` is refused on this target until then**, deliberately: what is there
now compiles a program that ends itself the first time an exception is
thrown, which is worse than saying no.

**One bug found and fixed on the way, worth not repeating.** The funclet's own
`sub rsp, 32` was written as unwind code `042H`. `UWOP_ALLOC_SMALL` is 2 with
`(size/8 - 1)` in the high nibble, so 32 bytes is `032H`; `042H` claims 40 and
leaves anything unwinding *through* a handler landing in the wrong place.

**`tools/windows/catch-check.cmd`** is the check this rung is for, and the
mirror of `throw-check.cmd`: that one has cl catch what cxx1 threw and says
nothing about this frame, while this compiles both halves with cxx1 and so
tests the funclet, the tables and the unwind data together. It either prints
what it should or the program ends.

### 6.5b step 1 as it actually landed: unwind data by hand

**Four assembler rules, each found by being stopped by it**, and none of them
in cl's listing - which is where the temptation is to look:

- **A label inside a `PROC` is local to it.** MASM scopes them by default, so
  the unwind data - which lives outside the procedure and measures into it -
  could not name the labels the prologue defines. `OPTION NOSCOPED`.
- **A segment cannot be called `.pdata` by default.** MASM will not take an
  identifier beginning with a dot. `OPTION DOTNAME`.
- **And it has to be called `.pdata`.** A segment called `pdata` is a segment
  called pdata: the linker builds the image's exception directory from
  `.pdata`, and without the dot the runtime finds no unwind record for the
  frame at all. This is the one that cost the most, because everything
  *assembled and linked and ran* - it only showed when an exception tried to
  leave a cxx1 frame. `dumpbin /summary` is what said it: `pdata` and `xdata`
  sitting beside `.text$mn`.
- **The attributes have to match** the ones the real sections carry, or the
  linker warns about two `.pdata` sections that disagree: `READONLY ALIGN(4)`.

**Every offset in the unwind codes is a label difference**, not a counted
byte. An unwind code records where in the prologue its instruction *ends*, and
`sub rsp, 40` is four bytes where `sub rsp, 400` is seven - the assembler
chooses, so the assembler is asked. Counting them here would be a second
encoder that has to agree with ml64 forever.

cxx1's prologue has one shape, so the codes do too: `UWOP_PUSH_NONVOL` for
rbp, `UWOP_SET_FPREG`, and an allocation that is `UWOP_ALLOC_SMALL` up to 128
bytes and `UWOP_ALLOC_LARGE` past it.

### 6.5a as it actually landed: `throw` on Windows

**The Microsoft ABI throws from the stack and carries its identity in four
objects**, where Itanium asks the runtime for memory and names one pointer:

    ??_R0H@8       the RTTI type descriptor - the type_info vftable, a spare
                   word, and the decorated name, `.H` for int
    _CT??_R0H@84   one catchable type: the descriptor, the object's size, the
                   virtual-base fields a scalar does not use
    _CTA1H         the array of those, with its count
    _TI1H          the ThrowInfo the runtime is handed

All measured from cl's listing, and the type's own letter runs through every
name, which is what makes them agree without anything being passed between
them. `Program::thrown` carries the list from the parser to the one backend
that needs it.

**Two things cl's listing shows but does not mean literally.** It writes
`DQ FLAT:??_7type_info@@6B@`, and `FLAT:` is 32-bit MASM's way of naming a
flat-model address - ml64 has no such keyword and rejects it. And it marks
each object `; COMDAT`, which is cl's object writer rather than assemblable
syntax: MASM cannot say COMDAT at all.

**So the four objects are file-local rather than PUBLIC**, and that is the
decision worth knowing. A public copy collides with cl's at the link -
measured, `LNK2005` on `??_R0H@8`. Keeping them private works because the
runtime matches a type descriptor by its **name string** rather than by its
address, which is the same rule that lets a throw cross a DLL boundary.

**Checked by a run**: `tools/windows/throw-check.cmd` has cxx1 compile the
thrower and cl the catcher, and `tools/verify-three` runs it with the cases.
An int and a double, because the object's size and the type that names it are
what that tests.

### 6.4 as it actually landed

**The objects are the ones a `return` already unwinds.** `alive_` holds them
and nothing new had to track them; the difference is only where the code runs
from - a landing pad rather than the return path, ending in `_Unwind_Resume`
rather than in a return. A cleanup region is a `Try` with an empty type list,
which is what makes the call-site table write action 0.

**One region per stretch, and the stretches do not overlap.** Two objects give
two ranges - after the first, after the second - each with a pad that destroys
exactly what exists by then. An exception thrown before the second is built
must not destroy it, and a call-site table holds sorted disjoint ranges, so
they are *split* rather than nested. The statements that do the constructing
are outside every region on purpose: an exception from a constructor leaves
that object unbuilt.

**A `Try`'s body became a list rather than a block**, because a cleanup region
covers a slice of an enclosing block's statements and must not open a scope of
its own - the objects it destroys belong to the block outside it.

**The bug worth keeping: resizing a vector down and back up is not undo.**
The first pad bounded its destructor list by shrinking `alive_` and restoring
the size afterwards, which default-constructs what it threw away - so the
*second* pad destroyed an object with no class and silently ran one destructor
short. `emitDestructors` takes an upper bound now and mutates nothing.

**Refused by name: a local with a destructor and a `try` in one function.**
Each is a range in the same call-site table and one would have to split the
other, which is the same reason a nested `try` is refused.

**Windows makes no cleanup regions and needs none**: `throw` is refused for
that target, so nothing can unwind through one of its frames, and the
destructors on the normal path are unchanged. Making them anyway would have
put a landing pad in a backend whose tables cannot describe one - which is
exactly what happened for one build, and `.Lfunc.begin.main` reaching ml64 is
what said so.

**`tools/mangled-names` asks with `-fexceptions` now** for the two Itanium
targets, where it used to ask with them off. The flag was hiding a feature
clang had and cxx1 did not; now it would hide cxx1's own work. Windows is
still asked with them off, for the same reason turned round. Two names are
excluded rather than argued with on every case that has a destructor:
`__clang_call_terminate` and `_ZSt9terminatev`, the guard clang emits for a
destructor that throws while an exception is already unwinding - cxx1 emits no
such guard, which is a real gap and not a spelling.

Suites 90 / 141 / 48.

### 6.3 as it actually landed

**Almost all of a `try` is ordinary statements**, which is what kept this
step from being much larger. A backend is told three things: a label before
the body and one after it, a label at the pad where the runtime arrives with
the exception pointer and the selector in two registers, and the type_info
symbols in order. Everything else - the selector comparison, the calls to
`__cxa_begin_catch` and `__cxa_end_catch`, the copy into the caught variable,
the handler bodies, and the `_Unwind_Resume` that nothing matched - is built by
the parser out of nodes that already existed, as a chain of if/else.

**Three bugs on the way, and every one of them was silent:**

**Every call in a function has to be in the call-site table**, not only the
ones inside a try. libc++abi takes a return address the table does not mention
as a program that should stop, so the ranges between and around the try blocks
are written out with no landing pad. Without them, an exception passing
through a function that has a table at all ended in terminate.

**The table needs a label that is not an `L` temporary.** Mach-O's
`.subsections_via_symbols` lets the linker move and drop the pieces of a
section and it cuts them at *symbols*; a temporary label is not one. With only
`L` labels every table in a file was a single atom, so the **first** try in a
file worked and the second did not - the exception simply was not caught, with
no diagnostic anywhere. clang writes `GCC_except_table0` for this reason and
not for readability.

**The call site's action field is a byte offset plus one, not a type index.**
With one handler the two are the same number and the difference is invisible;
with three, the second try's field has to skip six bytes rather than three
entries. The selector is an index into the *function's* type table too, not
into one try's handler list, which the parser has to know because it is what
its comparisons are written against.

**`tools/mangled-names` chooses `-fexceptions` from the source now.** A file
that writes `throw` or `try` cannot be compiled with exceptions off, and one
that does write them is asking for exactly the symbols the flag was hiding.
Recorded as a divergence: clang emits `__clang_call_terminate` for the case
where a destructor throws while an exception is already unwinding, and cxx1
emits no such guard. **This sentence used to say cxx1 ran no destructors
during unwinding at all**, which was true when it was written and stopped
being true when 6.4 landed a few hours later - the divergence is the missing
guard, not the missing destructors.

**Windows was unreachable when this landed** and the commit went in on two
boxes with that said out loud - `da6bf71` is the one commit here whose message
says so. **The box came back and it passes**: cxx1 builds with cl and all 45
of its cases run, with `try-catch` skipped for that target as its `.notarget`
says. So the gap was in the checking rather than in the code, which is the
outcome to hope for and not one to assume.

### 6.2 as it actually landed

**`throw x;` is three calls and a store, and it needed no new machinery.**

    void *e = __cxa_allocate_exception(sizeof x);
    *(T *)e = x;
    __cxa_throw(e, &_ZTI<T>, 0);

Written as one comma expression, so it is a statement wherever an expression
is one. The Itanium ABI puts the object in memory the runtime owns, hands it
over with the type that identifies it, and never returns.

**The type_info pointer was the whole of the work, as the plan said.** cxx1
has no RTTI: the vtable's typeinfo slot is a plain zero and `typeid` is
refused. For a *fundamental* type the object is already in the standard
library and `_ZTI` plus the type as a signature spells it - `_ZTIi`, `_ZTId` -
so the existing Itanium type encoding names it and nothing has to be emitted.
For a class or a pointer the compiler has to emit the object, and that is
refused by name rather than thrown with a type nobody can catch.

**Both sentences above are half stale, and the refusal still prints the stale
half.** `dynamic_cast` gave every polymorphic class a `type_info`, so for one of
those the object is already emitted and only the refusal stands in the way; a
class with no vtable still has none. Measured, and scoped with the other six
gaps, under "Class-typed exceptions: seven refusals, one of them stale".

**Windows lags here and the reason is a shape rather than an omission.** The
Microsoft ABI hands `_CxxThrowException` a ThrowInfo, which points at a
catchable-type array, which points at a copy record, which points at the RTTI
descriptor - four objects and an image-relative relocation, where Itanium
wants one pointer. Measured; refused by name for that target.

**Checked by a run, in the other direction from 6.1.** `tools/unwind-check`
grew a second half: cxx1 throws and the system compiler catches, an int and a
double, because the size of the object and the type that names it are what
that really tests - a wrong type_info is caught by nobody.

### 6.1 as it actually landed

**It is the same three directives in every function, because a cxx1 frame has
one shape.** The frame pointer is pushed and then established and never moves,
so the CFA is `rbp + 16` (or `x29 + 16`) for the whole body and the saved
registers sit just below it. Emitted where the frame is established rather
than beside each instruction, which is what clang does too: the unwinder looks
CFI up by *return address*, and a return address can only be inside a call -
there are none in a prologue.

**Checked by a run, because unwind data is either right or the program
aborts.** `tools/unwind-check` compiles three files - one that throws, one in
the middle, one that catches - with only the middle one compiled by cxx1. It
passes now and the same program aborted with "terminating due to uncaught
exception" before, which is what an opaque frame does to a personality
routine. It is in the repository rather than on a box, for the reason
`tools/cl-measure` is.

**cxx1 can throw nothing yet and that is the point of the check**: what is
being tested is the *frame*, and a frame is all cxx1 has to contribute for an
exception to cross it.

Suites 88 / 137 / 46 after 6.2, which adds only a refusal - what `throw`
actually does needs a handler, and the tool is where that lives.

## Rung 7: the C++11 layer - the plan it was built to, kept as written

**The last rung, and the widest.** Six features that mostly do not depend on
each other, so this splits where templates and exceptions had to be pushed
through in one piece. The order below is by what each one needs from the others.

**All of it landed** - see "Rung 7.6: lambdas, and the ladder is walked" and the
sections after it. "Nothing after 7.1 is written" was true the day this was
written and is kept because the plan is worth reading against what it became.

**7.1 has landed.** [dcl.spec.auto] says a variable's `auto` is deduced *as
if by template argument deduction from a function call*, which is not a
similarity to reuse but the rule itself - so `deduceOne` did the work
unchanged, decay and all, and `Kind::Deduced` stands where a type will be the
way `Kind::TemplateParam` stands in a pattern. Everything followed from that:
an array decays, a top-level const goes, `auto &` looks through itself and
keeps what it found, `auto *` deduces through a pointer.

**The initialiser is read twice** - once to learn its type, once to build it -
with the tokens put back in between. Reading it once would mean threading the
expression through every branch of the declaration path, the
class-with-constructors one included, to save a parse that costs nothing.

**Refused by name where C++14 begins**: a parameter's type and a function's
return type. Both said so with the standard named, because the answer to "why
not" is a version number rather than a gap.

**7.2 has landed**, and the prediction was right about where the work is: the
parser already types every expression, so all of it was in the rules.

**The rule is about tokens, not about the tree they build.**
[dcl.type.simple]: an unparenthesised name answers what that entity was
*declared* as; anything else answers the expression's type with a `&` added
when it is an lvalue. `decltype(n)` is int and `decltype((n))` is `int &` -
the same characters but for one pair of parentheses - so the shape of the
tokens has to be read before the expression is parsed.

**A reference variable is what forces the lookup rather than the tree.** Every
mention of one is lowered here to a dereference, so the *expression* `ref` has
type int where the declaration said `int &`. Asking the symbol table is the
only way to answer what was written.

`isLvalue` was already here, written for reference binding, and answered the
second half unchanged - the third time in this rung that the feature was a
rule the compiler already had.

**7.3 has landed for arrays.** [stmt.ranged] says what `for (T x : a)` means
by writing another loop, and every node that loop needs was already here - so
this performs the rewrite rather than adding a construct. The range is
evaluated once, which is what binding it to a name buys in the standard's
version and what assigning it to `__b` buys here.

**Telling it from an ordinary `for` takes a scan, and a `?` claims the next
`:`.** `for (int i = 0, n = c ? 2 : 5; ...)` has a colon and is not a
range-for, so the question marks are counted.

**Build through `arithmetic`, never a bare `Binary`.** `p + 1` on an `int *`
advances four bytes and that scaling lives in the helper the ordinary
expression path uses; a node built by hand with a type stamped on it read the
array one byte at a time - first element right, every one after it garbage,
which is what a missing scale looks like.

Refused by name: a class range, which needs `begin` and `end` found on the
class and called where an array's bounds are in its type; and a reference
loop variable, which needs the binding machinery a reference declaration has.

**7.4a has landed: `&&` as a type, and the binding rule.**

**7.4b has landed too: `static_cast`, and with it the third value category.**
`static_cast<T &&>` *is* `std::move` - the standard library's move is a cast
and nothing else - so until this existed no lvalue could reach a move
constructor and every one of them was unreachable.

What the cast makes is an **xvalue**, and it is carried as a one-bit mark on
`Expr` rather than as a type. The object and its address are unchanged; the
only thing said is that whoever takes it may take it apart. That splits the
old `isLvalue` in two, and the split is where all the behaviour is:

* `isGlvalue` - names an object. **Reference binding asks this**, so an
  xvalue binds to the object itself. Asking `isLvalue` there would have sent
  it to the temporary path, and a move constructor would have run on a copy -
  silently.
* `isLvalue` - names an object *and is not an xvalue*. **The rule that
  `T &&` refuses an lvalue asks this**, and so does argument ranking.
* `decltype` now has three answers rather than two, which is
  [dcl.type.simple]/4 in full: `T &&` for an xvalue, `T &` for an lvalue, `T`
  for a prvalue.

**A by-value parameter had to be taught separately.** `materialiseCopy`
predates rvalue references and reached for the copy constructor by name, so
`take(static_cast<S &&>(e))` copied and left `e` untouched where C++ says it
has been emptied. It asks for the move constructor first when the argument is
an xvalue. This is the same class of bug as the binding one - a path written
before a value category existed, which keeps working and gives the wrong
answer.

**`copyConstructorOf` was answering with move constructors.** It matched any
single parameter that `isReference()`, which was exact until `&&` became a
type in 7.4a. Two faults: the answer depended on which of the two was
declared first, and a copy could be routed to a constructor whose entire
contract is that it is never handed an lvalue. It skips rvalue references
now, with `moveConstructorOf` beside it; and because not finding a copy
constructor is how the implicit one gets declared, a user-declared move
constructor has to suppress that explicitly - which is [class.copy]/7, where
the implicit copy is *deleted*.

**7.4c has landed, and 7.4 with it: the move constructor the compiler
writes.** The divergence it was opened for is closed - a class with a member
whose move differs from its copy now prints `inner move` where it printed
`inner copy`.

[class.copy]/9 gives a class an implicit move constructor only if it declared
none of a copy constructor, a move constructor, a copy assignment, a move
assignment or a destructor - each being evidence the class manages something
by hand, and a memberwise move of such a class is how a double free happens.
**Two of the five cannot be written in this language yet**, so three are
checked; and they have to be read in `declareImplicitSpecials` *before* any
implicit member is declared, because a moment later every one of them answers
yes for a class that wrote nothing.

[class.copy]/15 makes the body a move of each base and each member, which is
`static_cast<T &&>(other.m)` for every one - so the synthesised body marks
each source as an xvalue and 7.4b's binding does the rest. **A subobject with
no move constructor is copied, and that is the language's answer rather than a
shortcut**: `T &&` binds to `const T &`, so moving something that has only a
copy is exactly what its copy constructor does.

**Nothing that calls the synthesiser had to learn about moves.** Which of the
three members is being written is read off the signature - an implicit
constructor whose parameter is `X &&` is the move constructor and there is
nothing else it could be - so `defineImplicitFunctions` is unchanged and the
one function writes all three bodies.

Implicit move *assignment* is provably unobservable here and is not written:
`operator=` cannot be declared at all, so every assignment in this language
bottoms out in memberwise scalar copies, and a move of those is a copy of
those.

**A general difference in the names, found here and not about moves.** On
x86_64-linux clang emits only the C2 variant of any *inline* constructor, and
a constructor the compiler writes is inline by nature with no out-of-line form
to switch to - so every implicit constructor meets it. Measured with an
implicit *copy* constructor, which shows the same C2-only set with no move in
sight. cxx1 emits C1 and C2 everywhere; the two are identical for a class with
no virtual bases and both are mergeable definitions, so the extra C1 costs
object size and nothing else. Darwin emits both and agrees on all 39 names,
Windows on all 20. In `implicit-move.nonames`, and it is the second case to
record it - `move-constructor.nonames` is the same fact reached by defining
constructors inside a class body.

**One thing the case had to be told to do.** `Base` was only ever built as
part of a `Derived`, and clang then has no use for its complete-object
constructor and emits none - which showed up as two cxx1-only C1 names on
Darwin. Building a `Base` directly is what the case was missing rather than
what cxx1 was doing wrong, and all 39 agree once it does.

**What `static_cast` does not do is refused out loud.** Its non-reference case
is handed to `convert()`, the same road the C-style cast takes, which is a
subset - a base-to-derived downcast is a `static_cast` and is not here.
`static_cast<T &&>` of a prvalue is refused too: legal C++, an identity, but
it needs a temporary materialised and there is no path here that does that.

**One measured difference in the names, and it is not about moves.** On
x86_64-linux clang emits only the C2 constructors for `move-constructor.cpp`
and calls them directly, where cxx1 emits C1 and C2 as it does everywhere.
The deciding thing is `inline`: every constructor in that case is defined
inside the class body, and writing the same three out of line makes clang emit
both on that target as well - which is why no earlier case met it. Darwin
emits both either way and agrees with cxx1 on all 8 names, so the mangling is
not in question. Recorded in `move-constructor.nonames`.

**An rvalue reference is the same machine as an lvalue one.** Both are a slot
holding an address, both are read by dereferencing it, so `isReference()`
answers for either and almost nothing outside binding and mangling had to
learn it exists. What differs is what may bind: `T &&` takes a value with
nowhere to live, `T &` an object that has somewhere.

**Which reference takes an argument is a question about the argument, not
about a conversion.** An rvalue reference is not viable for an object with an
address; where both are viable it is the better match. Those two lines in
`rankArgument` are the whole of how a move gets chosen over a copy.

Measured: Itanium writes `O` where an lvalue reference is `R`, and the
Microsoft ABI `$$Q` where it writes `A`.

**7.5 - `constexpr`.** The constant evaluator has been here since rung 1 -
`fold` is what array bounds and enumerators use - so `constexpr` on a
*variable* is close to `const` with a required constant initialiser. A
`constexpr` *function* is the real work: evaluating a call at compile time
means an interpreter over the AST, which is a second execution model beside
the backends.

**7.5a has landed, and most of it was not about `constexpr` at all.** The
plan above says a constexpr variable is `const` with a required constant
initialiser, and that was true - but it assumed the `const` half already
worked, and it did not. `fold` had no case for a *name*: it folded literals
and operators and stopped at the first identifier. So

```
const int n = 4;
int a[n];          // "expected an array length, and this is not an integer
                   //  constant expression"
```

and the same refusal for a case label, an enumerator value, a non-type
template argument and a nested `const int m = n * 2;`. Five doors into the
same evaluator, all shut. **[expr.const]/3 - a const object of integral type
initialised with a constant expression is a constant expression - is a rule
this compiler simply did not have**, and it is the rule that lets C++ write
`const int n = 4; int a[n];` where C reaches for a macro or an enum.

So the work was to give `Local` and `GlobalSym` a value to remember and teach
`fold` to read a `Var` back out of them. Locals before globals, the shadowing
order every other lookup uses. **The object is not folded away**: it still
exists, still has an address, and `&n` still works - what is answered is what
it is worth when read. Both suite cases take the address of a constant to say
so, and there is a second reason to: clang folds every use and emits no
symbol at all, so without an address taken the two disagree about what a
translation unit contains.

On top of that, `constexpr` itself is small. It sets `isConst` and one flag,
and the flag carries a *demand* rather than a meaning: an initialiser that is
not constant is an error where a plain `const` would have taken it and simply
not been usable as a constant afterwards.

**Two things needed saying that the plan did not mention.**
`atDeclarationStart` had to learn the keyword - it is a decl-specifier that
names no type, so without it `constexpr int n = 4;` inside a function went to
expression parsing and the reader was told an expression was expected, at a
keyword beginning a perfectly good declaration. And a `constexpr` *function*
is refused by name until 7.5b: accepted quietly it would compile and run
correctly, since a constexpr function may always be called at run time, and
would then fail to be constant in the one place the keyword was written for.
Finding it is a question about the token after the declarator, not about the
type - at that point the type is still the *return* type and the `(` has not
been read.

**A names-suite trap, and it is the assembler's.** `width` is a MASM reserved
word, so the MASM backend emits `$width` - deliberately, invisible to a
program, and stopping at the import boundary. `tests/names.sh` filters
`$`-prefixed symbols, so the case reported a difference that was about the
assembler and not about `constexpr`. The case renames the variable and says
why.

**7.5b has landed, and rung 7.5 with it. The plan called it "the real work:
an interpreter over the AST", and it is not one** - because of a restriction
this compiler's target version happens to impose. **C++11 lets a `constexpr`
function body be one return statement and nothing else**: no local, no loop,
no second statement. So running the function is *folding one expression* with
the parameters standing for the arguments. There is no program counter, no
statement dispatch and no state to carry, and recursion falls out of `fold`
already being recursive. C++14 relaxed the rule, and had this compiler
targeted C++14 the plan would have been right.

What it took was three things. `fold` gained a `Call` case: look the callee up
by its **mangled symbol**, fold the arguments, push a frame, fold the stored
expression, pop. A frame stack, because inside a call a local `Var` names a
parameter of a function whose frame does not exist - what it is worth is what
the call was given. And the expression itself, kept as a `const Expr *` into
the `Function` the `Program` owns, recorded before the body is moved into it.

**The arguments are folded in the caller's frame, before the push.** `fact(n -
1)` reads the caller's `n`; folded after, it would read the callee's parameter
sitting in the same slot. And there is a depth limit of 256, said out loud
where it is reached - [expr.const] lets an implementation have one, and a
compiler that recurses forever instead is worse than one that says no.

**Two mangling consequences, both measured against clang and neither
guessable.**

`constexpr` sets `isConst` because on an *object* that is what it means, and
on a **function** the const has to come back off: cl and clang both spell
`constexpr int sq(int)` as `?sq@@YAHH@Z`, which is `H` for `int` and not `?BH`
for `const int`.

And **a `constexpr` non-static member function is implicitly `const` in
C++11** - clang spells `Board::twice` as `_ZNK5Board5twiceEi` where cxx1 spelt
it `_ZN5Board5twiceEi`, and two object files with those names would not have
found each other. C++14 removed the rule, which is why clang *warns* about it
under `-std=c++11` rather than being silent, and why a compiler pinned to
C++11 has to keep it. It has to be applied in **two** places - the class body
and the out-of-line path - because a member defined inside its class is
declared by the first and defined by the second when its held body is
replayed, and one without the other makes a class refuse its own member.

**7.6 - lambdas**, last because they need the most from the rest: a closure is
a class with a call operator, generated where the lambda is written, holding
its captures as members. Both of the things it was blocked on now exist -
`operator()` is reachable, and a class can be defined inside a function; see
"Operator overloading" and "Local classes" below. **What is left is the lambda
itself**: the closure type, its captures as members, and the body as the call
operator's. Captures by reference then need 7.4's story about lifetime, and a
generic lambda would want `auto` in a parameter, which is C++14 and out of
scope.

## A replayed body inherited the enclosing function's live objects

**`alive_` belongs to the function being parsed, not to the one the replay
interrupted**, and `replayInlineBodies` put back seventeen pieces of
per-function state without it. So a lambda's `operator()` - which is parsed by
replaying its tokens through the ordinary member-definition path - began with
the *enclosing* function's constructed objects still listed, and its `return`
emitted their destructors against its own frame.

**What that looked like.** `std::vector<int> v; auto f = [](int a, int b) {
return a > b; }; f(5, 2);` aborted. The addresses say why: `v` sits at
`x29-8` of main and the lambda's `b` at `x29-8` of the closure's own frame, so
`~vector` ran *inside* the lambda with `this` pointing at the lambda's second
parameter - and read `items_` out of the arguments, `0x5_00000002` being the
5 and the 2 packed together. `free` was then handed that.

**It was a silent wrong answer far more often than a crash.** Any destructor
that only reads its members ran twice, once on the wrong object, and said
nothing; only one that frees turned it into an abort. A lambda in a function
holding *any* destructible object was enough, which is ordinary code - and the
344-case suite had no case of that shape, so it had been there since lambdas
landed. Found by compiling a four-line program that sorts a vector with a
lambda comparator; confirmed against `b8203cb`, so it predates this round.

**`pendingTemps_` goes with it**, being the same list for temporaries, and
`bodyCleanupFrom_` the bound the unwind regions read. All three are cleared for
the replay and put back after, exactly as the other seventeen are.
`tests/cases/lambda-after-destructible.cpp` pins what the destructor is handed
rather than how many constructors ran: destroyed once, after the lambda, with
its own address - and it reports `destroyed=2 wrongObject=1` on the compiler
before the fix.

## Three small steps the exercise needed: array references, computed arguments, the cast that was not one

**A reference-to-array parameter binds without decay.** `const double (&)[N]`
takes a `double[N]` lvalue, the element gaining const - a qualification
conversion, [dcl.init.ref] - where a by-value parameter would decay the array
to a pointer. An array's own `unqualified()` keeps its element's const, so both
`rankArgument` and `bindReference` ask the array case apart from the exact-type
one: same length, same element modulo const, and never dropping const onto a
non-const reference. The argument is not decayed, because `parseArguments`
never decays - it decays per-parameter, and a reference parameter asks for none.

**A non-type argument may be an expression of the parameters.** `V<N + M>` -
the concatenation's dimension - folds at instantiation, where N and M are
concrete. The pattern read that spells the Itanium name binds each non-type
parameter as *both* a reference (so a bare `V<N>` is `XT_E`) and its concrete
value (so `V<N + M>`, which is not a bare reference, folds rather than failing
to look N up). The folded argument then diverges from clang, which spells the
expression symbolically - `VIXplT_T0_EE` for N+M against cxx1's `VILi3EE` -
recorded per case; Microsoft uses the substituted signature and is exact. And
`specializationKey` keys a parameter reference by *which* parameter, `$P0`
against `$P1`, or `V<N>` and `V<M>` would intern as one type.

**`(T(x) == T(y))` is a comparison, not a cast.** A `(` before a type name
opens a C-style cast only when the type-id closes with its own `)`; `T(2.5)`
after it is a functional-cast temporary. So the cast is attempted through a
`Trial` - which turns the declarator parse's hard failure into a recoverable
one - and where the type-id does not reach a `)`, the `(` was a parenthesised
expression after all. This is the shape `assert(T(x) == T(y))` expands to, its
condition wrapped in parentheses, and it is the first use of the SFINAE trial
machinery outside template substitution.

## A class template-id as a qualifier in an expression

**`CNeeds<(N == 3)>::check()`** - the template-id is instantiated and a static
member of it is reached with no object. It reached `refuseTemplateId` before,
because `templateCall`'s class branch only handled `Box<int>()` - a temporary -
and anything else was refused. Now a `::` after the template-id is a qualified
member access, keyed on the instantiated tag exactly as `C::check()` is, and
only a *static* member is reachable this way, a non-static one needing an
object.

**The statement parser had to be told first.** `CNeeds<(N==3)>::check();`
opens with a class-template name, so `atTypeName` called it a type and the
declaration path read `CNeeds<1>::check` as a nested type - which failed in
`memberTypeWalk` rather than falling through to an expression. A leading
class-template-id whose member after the `::` is followed by `(` is a call or a
nested-type temporary, an expression either way, so `atDeclarationStart` steps
past the argument list by depth and answers no.

**This is the compile-time-check idiom, and it works because the false case does
not.** `CNeeds<true>` is defined with a `check`, `CNeeds<false>` is only
declared - so `CNeeds<(N==3)>::check()` is well-formed exactly when N is 3, a
`static_assert` written before there was one, and the dimension mismatch is the
missing member rather than a wrong answer.

## Function-template overloading, and deducing a non-type parameter

**Off the ladder, and what the Vector Exercise's operators stop at.** `a + b`
for a class template reaches `template <int N> V<N> operator+(V<N>, V<N>)`, and
`v * s` against `s * v` needs *two* `operator*` templates of one name. Three
things were missing and are here now: a non-type parameter deduced from a
class-template argument, function templates as overload-resolution candidates,
and more than one template of a name.

**Non-type deduction rests on a symbolic argument.** `V<N>` in a pattern is a
class-template-id whose argument is not a value but a *reference to* parameter
N - `TemplateArg::isParam`. Matching that pattern against a concrete `V<3>` is
what works N out: [temp.deduct.type], `deduceOne`'s specialization case reads
the value 3 out of the argument where the pattern holds a parameter. The
parameter is bound this way, rather than to a value, whenever a signature is
read as a pattern - `nonTypePatternParams_` records it, the same
Kind::TemplateParam signal a pack already used.

**That one primitive also spells the Itanium name.** A non-type parameter
argument is written `XT_E` - the parameter as the expression `T_` - so
`V<N>` comes out `1VIXT_EE` and `operator+<3>` is `_ZplILi3EE1VIXT_EES1_S1_`,
measured against clang. An operator template spells its operator code (`pl`,
not `9operator+`) and, like a named template, takes substitution candidate
zero; Microsoft writes `??$?H...`, the code where a named template-id writes
its name. This is the same `XT_E` the member-template mangling still wants -
implemented here for free templates, where the pattern signature is already
read.

**Templates join overload resolution through one door.**
`instantiateViableTemplates(name, argTypes)` tries every function template of
the name, instantiates each that deduces - a substitution failure just drops
one - and the specializations land in `functions_` under the name, where the
ordinary ranking chooses. It is called from `resolveOperator` (so `a + b`
reaches an operator template) and from the deduced call path (so `f(x)` tries
every overload). Class templates do not go through it: they do not overload.

**The key had to learn the signature.** `operator*(V<N>, double)` and
`operator*(double, V<N>)` both instantiate at N=3 and both keyed `operator*<3>`
- so the second was deduped to the first and the wrong one called. The
specialization key carries the substituted parameter types now
(`operator*<3>#V<3>#double`); the mangled symbol already distinguished them and
is unchanged, and the key is internal, the displayed name staying `operator*<3>`.

**Refused by name**: two *class* templates of one name (that is partial
specialization); and a non-type parameter that appears in no parameter, so a
call has nothing to work it out from - the message names the parameter.

## Member function templates, and the two binding layers

**A member function template is a template written inside a class**, `template
<int M> CVector<M> head() const`, called with explicit arguments, `v.head<3>()`.
It is core C++11 and was refused by name until now - the `template` keyword
reached the class-body member loop as something that is not a type. Off the
ladder, and the gate the Vector Exercise's CVector stops at.

**A member template is not a member and not a free template**, which is the
whole of the storage decision. It is kept in `memberTemplates_`, keyed by the
*concrete* class it belongs to - `"CVector<3>::head"` for an instantiation,
`"S::head"` for a plain class - beside the class-body loop that would have
declared an ordinary member. The declaration is recorded and its body skipped,
the same shape a free template uses.

**The crux is two binding layers.** `v.head<3>()` on a `CVector<4>` wants N=4
(the class's parameter) and M=3 (the member's) both in force when the body is
replayed - and the replay happens at the *call*, long after the class was made.
So the member template records the class's own parameters and the arguments this
instantiation bound them to, captured from `instantiatingParams_`/`Binding_`/
`Values_` while the class body was being read. At the call,
`instantiateMemberTemplate` binds the class's layer first and the member's
second, then replays.

**The replay is synchronous**, through `replayInlineBodies` - which saves and
restores the enclosing function's whole state, since a member-template call sits
in the middle of another function's expression. There is nothing to defer and
gate the way a free template's body is: a member template is always *used* when
it is called, so deduction's "made before it can be ranked" problem does not
arise.

**The inline-member replay reads a definition, not a declaration**, so the
member template declares itself on the way through. The class body held the
template and skipped it, so no ordinary member was ever declared - and the
member-definition path in `topLevel`, reaching a body it has no declaration
for, builds the signature then and there, keyed and mangled by the member name
plus its own arguments (`head<3>`). `memberTemplateInst_` and its fields are the
one-shot sign that this is happening.

**The mangling splits the way it always does: Itanium the pattern, Microsoft the
substituted signature.** Microsoft is exact on every member-template name -
`??$get@$06@S@@QEBAHXZ`, `??$head@$02@?$V@$03@@QEBA?AU?$V@$02@@XZ`, measured
against cl. Itanium is exact wherever the signature mentions no parameter -
`_ZNK1S3getILi7EEEiv` for `int get()`, measured against clang - and diverges
where it does: clang writes the *pattern* (`_ZNK1VILi4EE4headILi3EEES_IXT_EEv`,
the return `V<M>` spelled `S_IXT_EE` with M as the expression `T_`), where cxx1
writes the *substituted* signature (`S_ILi3EE`, V<3>). Carrying the pattern
through the member-template mangler, and spelling a non-type parameter as
`XT_E`, is the same split free function templates already make and is not yet
made here for members - the one recorded divergence, in
`template-member.nonames`, and the whole program runs correctly on all three
targets regardless, since the substituted name is unique per specialization and
consistent across cxx1's own object files.

**Refused by name**: a member *class* template, an *out-of-line* member template
definition, explicit instantiation inside a class, and a member template whose
arguments would have to be *deduced* from the call rather than written.

## Operator overloading, and why the names came first

**Off the ladder, and the reason it is next.** The ladder was never a map of
C++, and what is off it is now larger than what is on it. Operator overloading
blocks more than its size suggests: user-written copy *and* move assignment,
functors and therefore **lambdas (7.6), which cannot be attempted before it**,
and iterators and therefore range-for over a class. So it comes before the
last rung rather than after it.

**The table is in `src/Operator.h` and `src/Operator.cpp`, and every code in
it was measured.** One class declaring every overloadable operator, compiled
for both ABIs with clang, twice - and the second time was not optional.
Measured with the operators all taking the same argument, **half the Microsoft
codes are unreadable**: `??8`/`??9`, `??M` through `??P`, `??A`/`??R` and
`??Y`/`??Z` each come out as two identical signatures differing in one letter,
with nothing in the listing to say which letter belongs to which operator. The
second measurement gave every operator a *different* parameter type - char,
short, int, long, float, double, and the unsigned four - so each name
identifies exactly one row. The parameter type each row was measured with is
in the comment beside it, which is what makes a row checkable later.

**The one asymmetry between the ABIs is arity.** Itanium gives the unary and
binary forms of a token different codes - `ml` for `a * b` and `de` for `*p`,
`an` and `ad`, `mi` and `ng`, `pl` and `ps` - and Microsoft writes one code for
both and lets the parameter list separate them: `??D` is multiplication *and*
dereference. So an Itanium name cannot be built without knowing how many
operands were written and a Microsoft one can, which is why
`itaniumOperatorCode` takes a flag and `operatorPrefix` does not.

**The code goes exactly where a name's length and letters go**, and nothing on
either side of it changes: `_ZNK1VplERKS_` against `_ZNK1V3addERKS_`. That is
what made this small. `operator=` had been mangled by hand since rung 3 -
`aS` and `??4`, the one operator the compiler could name - and it turns out to
have been the general rule all along.

**One Microsoft rule that cannot be guessed and was measured**: the operator
code replaces the whole `?name@` and is **not pushed as a back-reference**. In
`??HV@@QEBA?AU0@D@Z` the class is back-reference *0*, where a named member
function would have left it 1. The `??4` of `operator=` already followed that
rule; it is written once now.

**Verified end to end, not just built**: `tools/mangled-names` over the
measurement files puts cxx1's names beside clang's for all three targets - 31
names for the binary set, 7 for the unary forms, 30 for a mixed file with
`operator=`, `->`, and pre- and post-increment. All agreeing, on
x86_64-linux, x86_64-windows and arm64-darwin.

### The dispatch is one place, because the expression parser already had one

Every binary operator in the parser funnels through `arithmetic`, `comparison`
or `shiftOf`, so `overloadedBinary` is asked once in each of those three and
nowhere else. It answers null when neither operand is a class - which is every
use in a C program and most in a C++ one - so the built-in paths reach their
work having asked one question about a type and nothing about operators.

**A member operator is looked for on the left operand only.** The left operand
is what [over.match.oper] hands the implicit object parameter, so `2 * v` can
never reach `V::operator*` however the class is written. That is not a
limitation; it is why the non-member form exists, and
`tests/cases/nonmember-operator` holds both halves of it.

**`memberCall` had to be split in two.** It read its own arguments off the
token stream, which is right for `a.f(b)` and impossible for `a + b`, where
the right operand was parsed long before anything knew there was a call here.
`memberCallWith` is the same function with the arguments handed to it.

### Two bugs this found, and only one of them was new

**`a += b` is not `a = a + b` when `a` is a class**, and for about ten minutes
it was. A compound assignment is built by reading the target back, combining
and storing, which is the correct rewrite for a built-in operand. The moment
`+` learned to find a class's `operator+`, the rewrite found it too - so
`a += b` compiled into a call the standard does not sanction, for a class that
had never declared `operator+=`. clang refuses the same program.
`tests/cases/operator-compound-refused` is that case. **The lesson is the
shape of it**: teaching an existing path a new trick teaches it to every
caller of that path, including the ones that wanted the old behaviour.

**Unary `+` accepted a class, and had since before any of this.**
`if (consume("+")) return decay(castExpr());` - a no-op with no check on what
it was applied to, which made `+v` the one operator that took a class in
silence. Found by running every operator over a class operand and putting
cxx1's accept-or-reject beside clang's, which is a sweep worth repeating
whenever a new operand type arrives.

### What is refused, and where

**An operator this compiler can name but cannot reach is refused at the
declaration**, not at the use - because a function that links, carries the
name clang gives it, and can never be called is exactly the half-built thing
this project refuses everywhere else. Which dispatch is missing depends on
arity, and arity is a question about the parameter list, so the check sits
where the parameters are known and not back where the name was read:
`operator-` with a parameter is subtraction and works, with none it is
negation and there is no path to it.

Reachable now: the sixteen binary operators `+ - * / % & | ^ << >>` and
`== != < <= > >=`; every **unary** form - `+ - * & ! ~` and `++ --` in both
their prefix and postfix spellings; and `operator()`.

Refused by name: `= [] , && ||` and the compound assignments; `operator new`
and `operator delete`; `operator->*`; a user-defined literal; and a conversion
function.

### The unary operators, and the two things that are not arithmetic

**`&` is an overload only where the class declared one.** A class that did not
still has an address, and `&obj` is the address-of it has always been - so
`overloadedUnary` answers *null* when it finds no candidate and each built-in
path is reached unchanged, rather than refusing because an operand was a class.
The same shape covers `*` on a pointer to a class. Only where a candidate
exists does the operator become a call.

**The postfix increment's dummy `int` is a real parameter, not a marker.**
[over.inc] gives the postfix form an extra int and passes 0 in it, which is the
whole of how `v++` is told from `++v` - and it is why `operator++(int)` is
written with a parameter nobody names. So the argument is *built* at the call
site, and postfix is then the ordinary two-operand resolution while prefix is
the one-operand one; one function answers both. It is also the one operator
whose arity lies to `checkOperatorDeclarable`, which counts two operands for a
member `operator++(int)` and has to let it through by name.

### `operator()` is the simplest of them, and the one 7.6 was waiting for

**[over.call] makes it a non-static member function and gives it no non-member
form** - alone among the overloadable operators - so the whole candidate set is
the class's own and `memberCall`'s ordinary resolution *is* the resolution,
arity and all. It is also the only one with no fixed number of operands, which
is why it is exempt from the arity check rather than listed in it.

**An operator function can be called by its name**, which is [over.oper]/1 and
was refused for as long as operators have worked here. The name was read in
declarators and nowhere else, so in an *expression* the keyword fell through to
the table of words this parser has no rule for and said `'operator' is not
supported yet` about a feature it had. Two places had to learn it: the
member-access paths, which read a name after `.` and `->`, and `primary` -
where the branch has to sit **before** the catch-all keyword refusal, or that
refusal claims the token first. `tests/cases/operator-by-name` holds all five
forms.

**The harder half was not the dispatch.** `v(1)` never reached the postfix
parser: a name followed by `(` was read as a call to a *function* of that name
before anything looked at what the name held, so an object was reported
undeclared. `callsThroughObject` already existed for exactly this - it keeps a
function-pointer variable out of the free-function branch - and a class-typed
name now takes the same route. One line, and it is the line that made the
feature work.

A closure is a class with a call operator, so this is the piece 7.6 was blocked
on. **What remains for lambdas is a local class to put one in**, cxx1 having
none. **The conversion function
is caught in the specifier path and not the declarator**, because
`operator int() const` is a declaration with no type in front of it - reaching
the end of `unqualifiedSpecifiers` having found `operator` is precisely what a
conversion function looks like from there, and saying so beats the generic
"'operator' is not supported yet" that the keyword table would have given.

**The two halves are ranked together, and at first they were not.** Asking
"does the class declare this operator" and only then looking at the
non-members takes the member whenever one exists - which accepts an ambiguity
clang refuses, and refuses a call a non-member could have taken. Both
directions were wrong and both are in `tests/overload/`.

`resolveOperator` builds the one candidate set [over.match.oper] asks for. The
shape that makes it possible: for `a @ b` a member takes `a` as its implicit
object parameter and `b` as its written one, a non-member takes both as
written parameters - two operands either way, so the rank vectors are the same
length and `betterCandidate` needs to know nothing about which half a
candidate came from. It answers *which half won* rather than which function,
and the caller then goes down the member or free path it already had; a member
that beat every non-member also beat every other member, so resolving again
within one set reaches the same candidate.

## `friend`, and why it landed beside the operators

**A friend is not a member, and nearly every mistake here comes from
forgetting that.** [class.friend]: the declaration is written inside the class
and the function it declares belongs to the *enclosing namespace*. It has no
`this`, it is not in the class's function table, it is not mangled into the
class, and `main` calls it exactly as it calls anything else. All the class
gives it is access - so the implementation is an ordinary function declaration
handed to the same `declareFunction` a file-scope one goes to, plus one entry
in a table.

**Two rules fall out rather than needing to be written.** The access specifier
a friend declaration sits under is ignored - [class.friend]/9 - which is true
here because `access` is simply never read on that path; and a friend reaches
private member *functions* as well as private data, because every access check
asks the same new question.

**The table holds linkage names, not source names.** Friendship is granted to
a *function*, and recording `peek` would befriend every overload of it -
including ones declared afterwards that the class never saw.
`tests/cases/friend-overload` is that case: `peek(const Account &)` is a
friend and `peek(const Account &, int)` is refused, which is what clang does.
So the grant is recorded as the symbol, looked up through `lookupSignature`
once the parameter list has been read.

**What asks the question is `currentFunction_`**, the linkage name of the
function whose body is being read, set beside the `declareFunction` that
registers a definition and cleared with `currentClass_`. It is left empty for
a *member's* body on purpose, and that is consistent rather than a gap: the
qualified form that would make a member somebody's friend is refused where it
is written.

**Five access checks, and all five had to learn it** - `checkAccessible`, the
member-call check in `memberCallWith`, the two constructor checks, and the
static-member one. They were already the complete list of ways past a private
member, so `isFriendOf` is asked in the same breath as "are we inside the
class" in each of them. A sixth check added later that forgets this is the
failure mode to watch for; there is no single funnel that would prevent it.

**It landed beside operator overloading because that is what makes each of
them useful.** A symmetric operator wants to be a non-member - `2 * v` cannot
be a member of V, the left operand being an int - and a non-member cannot see
what the class keeps private. `tests/cases/friend-operator` is both halves at
once, and neither feature alone would have carried it.

Refused by name: `friend class X;`, a friend function *defined* inside the
class body (the held-body replay members use would have to put this one back
outside the class it was written in), befriending one member function of
another class (`Other::look` would have to be found before `Box` is
complete), and a friend declaration that declares no function.

## Overload resolution is checked against clang, not against a recorded answer

`tests/overload.sh` over `tests/overload/`, and it is a suite of its own rather
than more cases in `tests/cases/` because the question is different. A case
there carries a `.expected`, which is a decision written down once; here the
interesting question is not "what does this print" but **"does cxx1 choose the
function clang chooses"**, and those are the same question only while somebody
keeps the recorded answer honest. The oracle is asked on every run, so the
corpus cannot drift away from it.

**It compares the verdict before it compares the output, and that half is what
catches bugs.** Overload resolution is as much about refusing an ambiguity as
about picking a winner, so a harness that only diffed the output of programs
that compiled would call "cxx1 accepted what clang calls ambiguous" a pass.
Every file is run both ways: clang refuses it and cxx1 must refuse it, or clang
accepts it and cxx1 must accept it *and* print the same thing. Each overload
returns a number of its own, so identical output means identical choices;
`0 * argument` keeps every parameter used without letting its value reach the
result.

Twenty files, covering the four forms the overloading has to work for -
functions, constructors, operators member and non-member, and friend functions
and friend operators - plus reference binding and value categories from 7.4,
inheritance in both the member lookup and the ranking, an ambiguity for each
form, and one file where all three meet: an overloaded *private* constructor
set reached only from a friend, which is the only place the access check has to
be got past before the ranking can be asked at all. The unary operators, the
two increments and `operator()` joined them as they landed, ambiguities
included.

**It found a real bug the moment it was written**, which is the argument for
it. See the operator-overloading section: the member and non-member halves were
being asked for in order rather than ranked together, and that is wrong in both
directions - it accepted an ambiguity clang refuses, and refused a call a
non-member could have taken. `resolveOperator` replaced it and both directions
are now files in the corpus.

clang is required, so this skips where there is none - the Linux box says so
rather than reporting a pass, exactly as `names.sh` does. It is a Mac suite in
practice, and that is where the mangling oracle already lives.

## Local classes, the last thing standing between here and lambdas

**[class.local]: a class defined in a function body belongs to that function.**
Two functions may each define `struct L` and they are two types, and neither
name is visible outside the function that wrote it. Before this the tag went
into the one table every class shares, so the second function was told its own
class was "defined twice" - and a global class of the same name could not be
shadowed at all.

**The tag is qualified the way a nested class's is**, with the enclosing
function's *source* name, so a diagnostic reads `struct f::L` rather than
spelling a mangled symbol at the reader. Where two overloads of one name each
define the same tag the source name is not enough, so the owner is checked and
a counter added - two classes silently interned as one is exactly the bug being
fixed. The written name is resolved through `localTypes_`, a scope emptied when
the function ends and asked *before* the file's types, which is what makes the
shadowing work.

**A specialization is not a local class even when a function asked for it.**
`Holder<int>` is instantiated on demand, in the middle of whatever named it -
often a function body - and the class it makes belongs to the file. Without
that exception the instantiation was renamed `f::Holder<int>` and the class
stopped being able to find its own constructor.

**Both ABIs wrap the enclosing function's whole name round the member's**,
which is what keeps two functions' `L::get` apart in one object file. Measured:

    _ZZ1fvEN1L3getEv              Itanium: _ZZ <function> E <ordinary entity>
    ?get@L@?1??f@@YAHXZ@QEAAHXZ   Microsoft: ?1? and the whole name, as a scope

Itanium wraps the ordinary name rather than building a different one, so the
member is spelled exactly as it would be outside a function and both names give
up their `_Z` to sit inside the wrapper. The Microsoft form is one more scope
component, and the embedded name is **not** pushed as a back-reference.

**Two owners are shaped differently and both are ordinary in real code.** A
function with no decorated name - `main`, or anything `extern "C"` - is written
by Itanium as a plain length-and-letters component (`4main`, there being no
`_Z` to take off) and by Microsoft as `?main@@9`, the `9` saying the name
carries no type information. A `static` function needs nothing special: its
name is `_ZL4stati` and the L comes along inside the wrapper.
`tests/cases/local-class-main` holds both.

### The replay is a nested parse, and it was eating the enclosing function

A local class's member bodies are held and replayed the moment the class
closes - which is *in the middle of* the function that wrote it, through the
same `topLevel` that sets a function up and clears what it finds. So the
enclosing function lost its parameters and its locals:
`h(int k) { struct M { ... }; M m; m.z = k; }` was told `k` was not declared,
because reading `M::get` had emptied the table `k` lived in. `replayInlineBodies`
saves and restores the lot now - locals, frame vars, scopes, blocks, labels, the
frame size, `this`, and the current class - having previously restored only the
token position.

**And it found a memory bug older than any of this.** The signature a
definition looks up was held as a `const Signature *` into `functions_`, which
is a `std::vector`, while the body was read. Anything declared during that body
can grow the vector and move it. Nothing declared anything there until a class
could be defined inside a function - its member functions are declared exactly
then - and `Outer::m` came out under whatever string happened to be at the old
address: `m` in one build and `a` in the next. Only the symbol is wanted
afterwards, so only the symbol is kept, by value.
`tests/cases/local-class-in-member` is that case.

**A stale object file cost an hour of this.** `git stash` to build the previous
commit and `git stash pop` afterwards leaves mtimes that convince `make`
nothing changed, so the tree was half-old and crashed in a way neither `-O0`
nor ASan reproduced - because those were clean builds. `make clean` before
believing a crash that only one build shows, and see "How correctness is
established", which says the same thing about green suites.

**What is left for lambdas** is the lambda itself: a closure type generated
where the expression is written, with its captures as members and `operator()`
holding the body. The class it needs can now exist, and so can the call
operator.

## Two bugs an audit found that no suite would have

Both came from running plain C++ past the compiler and diffing accept/reject
and *output* against clang - the same method `tests/overload.sh` automates for
one feature, done by hand across the language. Neither was reachable from any
existing case, which is the point: a suite only tests what somebody thought to
write down.

**`S a[4];` ran no constructors at all.** The branch that builds a class local
asks `isStructOrUnion()`, and an array of S is an array - so it fell through to
an ordinary uninitialised local. It compiled, linked, ran, and every element
held whatever was on the stack: clang printed `3 3 3 3` where cxx1 printed
`-16 -1 1803348728 1`. **The only silent wrong answer found in the whole
audit**, and ordinary code.

Why nothing caught it: a class array as a *member* is built by the memberwise
path and always worked, and `new T[n]` is refused by name - only the local
declaration had nothing. `constructLocalArray` runs the default constructor per
element through the loop `eachElement` already provided for member arrays, and
unwraps every array level at once, so `T g[2][3]` is six elements of T rather
than two of `T[3]`.

**Its destruction is refused by name rather than half-built.** [class.dtor]
destroys elements in reverse when the scope ends, and `emitDestructors` is
shared with the exception paths on all three targets - it knows one object per
entry, and teaching it a count belongs with that machinery rather than beside a
declaration. So an array of a class with only constructors works and an array
of one with a destructor says so. Nothing is silently left undestroyed, which
is the failure the whole branch exists to stop.

**Taking a function's address used the written name, not the linkage name.**

```cpp
int g(int n) { return n * 2; }
int (*p)(int) = g;     // emitted `g` where the function is _Z1gi - link failure
int (*q)(int) = &g;    // typed `int (*)(int) *`, which nothing can be assigned
```

A *call* went through the signature and so through the symbol; a function named
as a **value** did not. Correct while this compiler was C, and wrong from the
moment rung 2 mangled anything - `extern "C"` kept working, which is why it
lasted this long. One line: `v->setSymbol(sig->symbol)` beside the `Var::global`
that the name builds.

And `&f` and `f` are the same thing for a function: [conv.func] has already
turned the designator into a pointer by then, so taking its address again built
a pointer to a pointer with no object under it. The test is the *shape* and not
the type - `&p` where p is a variable holding a function pointer is an ordinary
address-of and still is.

## Default arguments, and the scope they are read in

**A default is kept as a place in the token stream, not as a parsed tree.**
[dcl.fct.default]/9 evaluates it afresh at every call that leaves the argument
out, so one tree could not have been handed to two call sites anyway without a
general clone this parser does not have - and re-reading a recorded range of
tokens is what it already does for a member function's held body. The place is
recorded where the parameter list is read and the expression is parsed again at
each call that needs it.

**Three parameter-list parsers had to learn it**, which is the shape of this
file rather than of the feature: `parameterTypes` for declarations, the loop
`topLevel` keeps for definitions, and constructors through `declareConstructor`.
`pendingDefaults_` carries them the short distance to whichever `declare()`
records the function, the way the class-instantiation fields already carry a
tag, and `defaultArgs_` keys them by the **linkage name** so a redeclaration
cannot give one function two sets.

**In `topLevel` the handover sits before the prototype branch and not after
it.** That branch declares the function and returns, and
`int f(int a, int b = 3);` declared there and defined further down is the
ordinary way to write one - put the handover after it and exactly the common
form is the one that does not work.

**The caller's locals are put aside while a default is read**, and this is the
part worth keeping. The expression is parsed at the *call*, so a local in the
calling function could quietly capture a name the default meant globally. A
default at namespace scope may name globals, enumerators and static members and
may **not** name a local or another parameter - so hiding the locals is what the
declaration's scope actually is from here. `tests/cases/default-argument` pins
it with a `shadow()` whose local `base` shadows the global the default uses.

**Overload resolution now ranks a candidate against fewer arguments than it has
parameters**, the count a call may give being a range: `leastArguments` counts
the parameters with no default, and only the arguments actually written are
ranked - a default is the same expression for every candidate that has one and
cannot tell two of them apart.

[dcl.fct.default]/4 - the defaults must be a suffix - is one shared check called
from both parameter-list parsers, because a definition may carry them where the
declaration did not.

## A by-value parameter and a reference to it are the same match

**`f(int)` beat `f(const int &)` for an lvalue without a word**, where clang, g++
and cl all call the pair ambiguous. [over.ics.rank] gives neither a way to win:
one copies the argument and the other binds it, and both are the identity
conversion. The same for a prvalue, `f(4)`.

**Why it was wrong is the interesting part.** A reference binding is charged a
*qualification* conversion here for the const it adds - and that charge is not
a mistake, it is how two tiebreaks are encoded in one number: [over.ics.rank]
/3.2.6, the less qualified of two references winning (`hold(int &)` over
`hold(const int &)` for an lvalue), and /3.2.3, an rvalue reference beating a
const lvalue reference for an rvalue. Both only ever compare two *references*.
Against a by-value parameter the charge is not a difference at all, and letting
it decide is what made `f(int)` win. So `betterCandidate` neutralises it in
exactly that pairing - `sameMatchEitherWay`, a by-value parameter and a
reference to the same type - and the encoding stays for the two comparisons it
is right about. Deleting the charge instead was tried first and cost the
rvalue-reference preference: `g(S &&)` stopped beating `g(const S &)` for
`static_cast<S &&>(a)`, which the overload suite said at once.

**The neighbour found a second defect, and it was the worse one.** Writing the
case that had to keep resolving - `hold(int &)` against `hold(const int &)` -
showed `hold(7)` coming out *ambiguous* where all three oracles pick the const
one: a mutable reference was being ranked as viable for a temporary. With one
candidate it never showed, because the call path refuses the binding later and
by name; with two it did. `T &` is not viable for a value now, at ranking, which
is where clang says "no matching function".

Both are in `tests/overload/`, where clang is asked on every run rather than a
recorded answer: `ambiguous-value-vs-reference.cpp`, which both must refuse, and
`reference-constness.cpp`, which both must resolve the same way. **All three
oracles agree on every shape here** - measured on g++ 11.5 and cl 19.44 as well
as clang - which is a different situation from the const rule beside this one,
where cl stands apart.

## A const object has to be initialised, and the line is CWG 253's

**`const S s;` on a plain struct compiled and left the object holding whatever
was there**, which is [dcl.init]/7's whole subject: a const object that nothing
initialises can never be given a value afterwards, so the declaration is
ill-formed rather than merely unwise. It is refused now, at a local and at file
scope alike, `extern` excepted because that declares rather than defines.

**Where the line falls was measured against all three, fifteen shapes, because
the paragraph's letter and what compilers do are not the same.** [dcl.init]/7
says "a class type with a user-provided default constructor"; clang applies CWG
253, which asks instead whether anything would be left unset - **and g++ answers
identically on every one of the fifteen**, which is what made it safe to take:

```cpp
struct A { int a; };                 const A a;   // refused, and clang refuses
struct B { int a; B() : a(1) {} };   const B b;   // a constructor of its own
struct C { int a = 5; };             const C c;   // every member initialised
struct D { B b; };                   const D d;   // a member that answers for itself
struct E : B { };                    const E e;   // and a base that does
struct F { int a = 1; int b; };      const F f;   // refused: b is left unset
struct G { B b; int n; };            const G g;   // refused, for the same reason
const int n;                                      // refused
const A arr[2];                                   // refused
```

**cl is looser, in exactly three of the fifteen, and cxx1 does not follow it.**
Measured with cl 19.44 at `/std:c++14 /permissive-` - it has no C++11 mode to
ask: a bare POD local (`const A a;`), an array of one (`const A arr[2];`) and a
POD at file scope are all accepted there and refused by clang, by g++ and here.
It refuses `const int n;` and the mixed cases as they do, so its rule is closer
to "a class is fine, a scalar is not" than to CWG 253's walk. Where a *language*
rule has the two Itanium oracles agreeing against cl, this tree follows them and
records the difference - which is the opposite of how an *ABI* question is
settled, and worth keeping straight: cl is the authority on the Microsoft ABI
and no authority at all on what C++ means.

`constDefaultInitialisable` is that walk, and it is recursive because the rule
is: a user-provided constructor answers for the whole class, and otherwise every
base and every member has to answer for itself. A member the layout copied down
from a base is skipped, since the base already answered - `memberFromBase` is
that test, which the destructor walk had been spelling out inline.

**The refusal names two spellings that work.** `const S s = S();` and
`const S s = {};` both compile - the second only since 2026-09-03, and until
then it was the first thing a reader tried after this refusal and the second
wall they met. See "An empty pair of braces is value-initialisation" below.

## An empty pair of braces is value-initialisation

`{}` is not a list with nothing in it. [dcl.init]/11 sends it to /8, the
paragraph `T()` already followed here, and the two are the same thing written
two ways. Implemented 2026-09-03; before that every spelling of it was refused,
and by three different messages: one about lists needing a value, one about
list-initialisation, and for the rest `expected ';'` two tokens later.

Where it is read: an initialiser after `=` - `int n = {}`, `P p = {}`,
`const P p = {}`, at file scope, on a static local, on a static data member -
the direct form written with no `=` (`P p{}`, `int n{}`, `C c{}`), and
`new T{}` and `new T[n]{}`.

**The two halves of /8 are the whole of the work.** For everything without a
constructor it is a zeroing: `initZero` says it in a function, and at file scope
it is said by emitting no piece at all, which `segmentFor` already reads as
`.bss`. For a class with a constructor, value-initialisation *calls* it - and
zeroes the object first only where that constructor is implicit, since one
somebody wrote is the whole of the initialisation. `constructLocal` carries that
half, spelled as `ParserExprNew` had already spelled it for `T()` and `new T()`.

| written | what happens |
| --- | --- |
| `struct U { int a; int b; U() { a = 1; } }; U u = {};` | `U()` runs, and `b` is left as it was |
| `struct I { int a; int b; }; I i = {};` | zeroed, then the implicit constructor |

Measured on the arm64 assembly rather than argued: the first calls one function
and stores nothing, the second stores two zeroes and then calls.

**`= {}` is copy-initialisation and `{}` is not**, which is the whole of what an
`explicit` default constructor changes - clang refuses `C c = {};` there and
takes `C c{};`, and so does this.

**What is still refused, and by name.** Braces with a value in them are
list-initialisation - `P p{1, 2}`, `new P{1}` - which this compiler does not do.
The refusal says so and names `= {...}`, which for everything it reads braces on
means the same thing; before this it was `expected ';'` two tokens later.
`int a[] = {};` is refused because `{}` counts nothing and an array of no
elements is not C++ - clang calls that an extension and refuses it under
`-pedantic-errors` too. A member's own initialiser written `int a = {};` keeps
the refusal it had: that one is replayed as an expression once per constructor,
which is a different mechanism from any of the above. `auto x{}` now joins
`auto x = {}` in being refused for the reason that is true of it - deducing from
braces wants an `initializer_list` - where it used to be told it had no
initialiser at all.

`tests/cases/value-init-empty-braces.cpp` runs twenty of them,
`list-init-values-refused.cpp` and `empty-braces-no-length-refused.cpp` pin the
two refusals.

## An enumeration keeps its name, which is half of being a type

**`void f(Colour)` was `_Z1fi`**, so no cxx1 object naming an enumeration could
link against one from another compiler - and that is what blocked a
file-by-file differential against a clang build of the same sources, which is
the tool that then found a miscompilation in one file out of sixteen.

**An enumeration is now a distinct `Type` that is an `int` in every respect
except its name.** `Kind::Int`, the same size and alignment and conversions and
arithmetic, interned per tag, carrying the qualified name that only the
manglers read. Both spellings measured, four shapes each:

    void a(Colour)          _Z1a6Colour           ?a@@YAXW4Colour@@@Z
    void b(cc::BinaryOp)    _Z1bN2cc8BinaryOpE    ?b@@YAXW4BinaryOp@cc@@@Z
    void d(Colour, Colour)  _Z1d6ColourS_         ?d@@YAXW4Colour@@0@Z

Two details neither ABI makes obvious. Itanium spells an enumeration *exactly*
as it spells a class - the `N...E` appears for a namespaced one for the same
reason, and the whole name is a substitution candidate, which is what makes the
repeat `S_`. Microsoft writes `W4` where a class writes its `U` or `V`, and the
repeat is the argument table's digit - so an enumeration has to **take a slot in
that table**, which it did not, its kind being `Kind::Int` and the gate asking
`microsoftBuiltin`.

**What this is not is a type.** Underneath it is still an integer, so
`Colour c = n;` for an `int n` is still accepted where C++ requires a cast.
`docs/CONFORMANCE.md` says so plainly and says what finishing it costs: a
`Kind::Enum` carrying its enumerators, conversions in both directions, and
overload resolution ranking them. Held back deliberately - the ABI was what
blocked the differential, and opening the type system is its own round.

`nested-enum` lost its `.nonames` and `.nocl` with this: it had recorded the
old divergence on all three targets and now agrees name for name.

## A base's members were built twice, and the second time was wrong

**The layout copies a base's data members down into the derived class's list** -
that flattening *is* the layout - and the base's own constructor has already
built them by the time the derived constructor's body runs. Both constructor
walks built them again, default-constructing over whatever the base had set.

So a base whose constructor does work through a member that has a constructor
was correct alone and wrong the moment anything derived from it:

    Base b;      // cur holds what Base's constructor put there
    Derived d;   // cur holds its default-constructed state

**A plain `int` member hid it for a long time**: there is nothing to rebuild, so
the second walk writes nothing and the bug is invisible. It needs a member with
a constructor of its own to show at all.

**The destructor walk has skipped base members since implicit destructors
landed.** `memberFromBase` is that test and the comment beside it says why - a
base's own destructor deals with what it brought. Neither constructor walk asked,
and there are two: the one that synthesises an implicit default constructor, and
the one that fills in what a user-written constructor's initialiser list left
out. Both ask now.

**This is what made cxx1's build of Compiler++ reject every program.** Its
parser derives from a base whose constructor reads the first token into a
member, and that member was default-constructed again straight afterwards - so
the parser always saw `TOK_UNKNOWN` at line 0, whatever the input, including an
empty file.

**How it was found is the part worth keeping.** Seven probes of the shape had
already come back correct, each a guess about a program of sixteen files. What
found it was building the *same sources* with clang and cxx1 and diffing the
behaviour, then narrowing by writing a harness that called Compiler++'s lexer
directly - which proved the lexer right and moved the search to the parser.
The differential is the oracle; the probes were only ever hypotheses.

    128 of Compiler++'s own 129 test cases now behave identically under both
    builds. The remaining one aborts, and is its own finding.

## `inline`, a linkage hint on machinery that already existed

**`inline` on a function makes its definition mergeable across translation
units** - [dcl.inline]/6 - which is exactly the weak/COMDAT emission a template
specialization and an inline-member body already get. So the whole feature is
three lines: consume the keyword in the specifier loop as a `Qualifiers` flag,
and OR it into the `setInline` at emission, which the two Itanium targets spell
`.weak` / `.weak_def_can_be_hidden` and Windows spells COMDAT. `static inline`
stays non-weak, because the `!internal` guard already there says an
internal-linkage function is per-translation-unit whatever else is written.

**The name is unchanged** - `inline` is about linkage, not the type - so
`names.sh` checks it against clang, which spells the same symbol `linkonce_odr`,
and a two-object link folds the copies rather than rejecting them. The keyword
moved from `pending[]` to `implementedElsewhere[]`, so `inline` in an expression
now says it is implemented and does not begin one rather than that it is
unsupported.

**Refused by name: an inline *variable*.** That is a C++17 feature; C++11 has
`inline` only on functions. The refusal is where a non-function declarator is
seen with the flag set, and it names the standard version.

## Weak definitions, and the link that follows from them

**781 duplicate symbols became none**, and Compiler++'s sixteen objects became
a program. Three kinds needed the marker, and finding them was a matter of
running the linker three times.

**An inline function.** [dcl.inline]/6 makes a member defined inside its class
implicitly inline, and an inline definition may appear in several translation
units - so the linker folds the copies rather than rejecting them. Everything
that reaches `topLevel` through a *replay* is one, which is exactly the set:
a member written inside a class body, and every member of a template
specialization, are replayed the same way. `replayingInline_` is that flag.

**A compiler-written special member.** [class.copy] and its neighbours make the
implicit definition inline too, and those never go through `topLevel` at all -
they are built directly, at five sites in `ParserClass.cpp`.

**And the three objects a polymorphic class emits**: its vtable, its typeinfo
and the typeinfo's name string. Those are data rather than code, so the flag
went on `Global` beside `prefixWord` and the globals path emits the same marker.

The spellings were already written down, measured from clang, in
`docs/CONFORMANCE.md` - `.weak` on ELF, `.weak_def_can_be_hidden` on Mach-O,
both beside the `.globl` rather than instead of it. The Spelling base class
answers with nothing by default, so a target that has not been measured says
nothing rather than something wrong: **Windows is that target today.**

### `std` is written `St`, and the bug was invisible twice over

**`std::string` is `St6string`, not `N3std6stringE`** - the Itanium ABI gives
`::std::` one of its predefined abbreviations. Every cxx1 object that named a
type from its own headers had the wrong symbol.

It was invisible in a single-file program, and invisible in an all-cxx1 link,
both being self-consistent. It shows the moment a cxx1 object meets a clang one
- and `tools/mangled-names` skips exactly the cases that would have caught it,
because a case including a C++ library header is compiled by clang against
*clang's* library and the two symbol lists have nothing in common. A `.nonames`
that says "there is nothing to compare here" is right about the library and was
hiding a fact about the ABI.

Two of the four measured rules are not guessable: `std::deep::inner` is
`NSt4deep5innerE`, the wrapper coming back once the name is deeper than one
component; and `f(std::string, std::string)` is `St6stringS_`, which says `St`
takes **no numbered slot** - the whole of `St6string` is candidate zero.

**A specialization is still spelled without it**, and `docs/CONFORMANCE.md`
records why: templates are keyed by their bare name, so `std::vector<int>` does
not know which namespace it came from. That is the same root as the local
`count` that lost to `std::count`, met from the other side.

## All sixteen of Compiler++ compile, and the link is a different question

**16 of 16 sources compile and assemble** as of 2026-09-04. That is worth
stating precisely, because it is not the same as "cxx1 compiles Compiler++":
the objects do not yet link, and nothing has been run.

The last source wanted three things, and only the first is about templates.

**A statement may begin with a type.** `std::vector<T>().swap(v);` -
`atDeclarationStart` saw a type name and claimed the line, so the declarator
path wanted a name where the `(` was. An **empty pair** after the type is what
says otherwise: a declaration needs a name between the type and the `(`, so
`T ();` could only be a function declaration with no name. `int (*p)();` has a
`*` there and is untouched.

**The walk over a qualified name stops at the `<`**, because for its own purpose
the name is what matters - so the empty pair was looked for at the wrong token.
`qualifiedTypeEndPastArgs` steps over the argument list by depth, counting a
`>>` as two, and both callers ask it.

**And a class template-id is a temporary where a plain class name already was.**
`refuseTemplateId` answered for every template in an expression; a class
template followed by `(` reaches `classTemporary`, the same function `P(1)` has
always used.

### What the link found, which no single-file case could

**A base's implicit default constructor was never defined.** `struct Decl :
Node { virtual ~Decl() {} };` has no constructor of its own, so the implicit one
runs and it is not trivial - something stores the vptr. A user-written derived
constructor that names no base calls it, and that path took the signature **by
value** where the branch beside it goes through `resolveOverload`, which marks
the table's entry used. The copy was marked; the table's entry was not; and
`defineImplicitFunctions` never gave it a body. It compiles, it assembles, and
the linker says `Undefined symbols: cc::Decl::Decl()`.

**It links until something derives from a class with a vptr and no constructor
of its own**, which is why a suite of single-file cases never saw it - every
case that could have was written with a constructor. This is the argument for
linking as an oracle rather than compiling: `tests/emit.sh` stops at assembly by
design, and an undefined symbol is invisible to it.

**And what stops the link now is recorded rather than new**: 781 duplicate
symbols, every inline member of every header in every translation unit.
`docs/CONFORMANCE.md` has had "an inline member function is a strong symbol"
since inline members landed - cxx1 has no COMDAT and no way to say a definition
is mergeable. A single-file program never meets it. Sixteen that share headers
meet it 781 times.

## `Base::f(...)` - the version an override replaced, and who may call it

**[expr.call]/1: naming a function with a qualified-id suppresses the
dispatch**, which is the whole reason an override writes `Base::f(...)`. Two of
Compiler++'s sixteen sources do, as `cc::Lowering::lowerDecl(d)`.

Three things had to be true, and the branch that already existed for a *static*
member function is the shape they were built on - it claims the name only where
the set holds a static, and refuses a non-static one by name, which is exactly
the door this came through.

**The lookup does not walk up.** A qualified call says which class's version it
means, so `findMemberOwner` is not asked and `memberCallWith` takes the owner as
given - one parameter, which also turns the dispatch off.

**The base's own name has to resolve.** `cc::Base::f` is in the type table;
plain `Base::f` is the **injected class name**, which is not - so the bases are
walked and their `localName()` compared. That is the same half the
mem-initialiser list needed one commit earlier, and finding it twice in two days
is the argument for a shared helper the next time it comes up.

**And protected reaches further than private does.** [class.access.base]/5 lets
a derived class name a protected member of its base, and `insideAccessOf` asked
only "are we inside that class" - so a protected static called unqualified from
a derived member was refused. It takes the member's access now, because private
and protected are different questions and answering them with one test made the
stricter answer wrong. A private member of a base is still refused, which is the
half worth testing.

## A base named with its namespace in a mem-initialiser list

**`: cc::Lowering(module, l, d)`** is how a class writes a base that is not in
scope unqualified, and both spellings were refused. The qualified one read a
single identifier and then wanted a `(`, finding `::`. The unqualified one -
`: Base(v)` for a `cc::Base` - resolved nothing, because the base's tag is
`cc::Base` and the entry was compared against it as a string.

**The comparison by type was already there and could not answer.** It was added
when a base in a namespace first appeared, and it needs `findTypedef(entry)` to
resolve the written name - but inside the derived class `Base` alone is the
**injected class name**, which is not something the type table holds. So the
base's `localName()` is compared as well, that being exactly what the injected
name is.

The list reads a qualified name now, and either spelling arrives at the same
base. What goes in the map is the tag either way, because that is what the walk
over the bases looks it up by - the string is the key, and the matching is the
part that had to stop being a string comparison.

## A local named `count` lost to `std::count`

**`findTemplate` keys every template by its bare name on purpose**, so that
`std::vector` finds `vector`; the note there says two namespaces cannot each
have a template of one name anyway, and that widening what can be *named* does
not widen what can be *declared*. True, and it had a second effect nobody
looked for: an **unqualified** `count` found `std::count` from anywhere, with
no using-directive in sight.

So including `<algorithm>` broke any program with a local called `count`,
`find`, `swap`, `min`, `max`, `sort`, `fill`, `copy`, `equal`, `merge` or a
dozen more - a wide class of ordinary programs, and one of Compiler++'s sixteen
sources stops on `count = pop().i;`.

**The fix is one condition and not a re-keying.** [basic.lookup.unqual] gives
the nearest declaration, so a name declared as an object is not a template
name. Re-keying every template by its namespace is the other repair and a much
larger one; this is the rule the standard states, and a program with both a
template and an object of one name in one scope is ill-formed anyway.

**Only unqualified lookup gets the test, and the first attempt got that
wrong.** The namespace branch consumes `std::` and then asks about the bare
name, so testing there killed `std::count(...)` beside a local `count` - which
is exactly what a program writes, and what the case now pins. A qualified name
has said which namespace it means and nothing local can be intended.

## Two declarators, one declaration, and a `continue` in a `do`/`while`

**`std::string a, b;` was refused** with `expected ';'` pointing at the second
name - as ordinary a line of C++ as there is. The entry in the table above
blamed the constructor *arguments*, because `P a(1), b(2);` is the shape it was
first written down in. It was never about the arguments: `P a, b;` failed the
same way, and so did every class with a constructor.

The declarator loop is a `do` / `while (consume(","))`, and the three branches
that build a class ended with

    if (!consume(",")) break;
    continue;

**`continue` in a `do`/`while` jumps to the condition**, which consumes a comma
of its own. So the comma was taken twice, the loop ended, and the second
declarator was left for `expect(";")` to trip over. The comma belongs to the
condition; the branches just `continue`.

Worth the section for the shape rather than the size. A `continue` that means
"next iteration" in a `for` or a `while` means "test the condition now" in a
`do`, and where the condition has a side effect the two are different
programs - which is why the fault reached three branches written at three
different times and none of them looked wrong on its own.

## A class template's member is instantiated only where it is called

**[temp.inst]/2: instantiating a class template instantiates the declarations
of its members, not the definitions.** A body is compiled only where something
calls it - which is exactly what lets `std::vector<T>` hold a `T` with no
default constructor while still *declaring* `vector(size_type)`, whose body
says `T()`.

cxx1 gated a replayed body on the member's **name**, and every constructor of a
class shares one key. So `Box<NoDefault> b;` marked that key used and replayed
*every* constructor's body with it - the one nothing called was compiled for a
`T` it cannot be compiled for, and the class would not instantiate at all.

**It was invisible until a second constructor existed.** Every class template in
the tree had one, so name and overload were the same question; adding
`vector(size_type n)` to `include/vector` broke four of Compiler++'s sixteen
sources at a stroke, none of them naming a constructor. The gate is the
overload now: each body carries the index of the signature its declaration
added, and falls back to the key where the declaration added none - a lambda's
call operator, which is recorded without one.

**And the element storage is raw**, which is a constraint rather than a
shortcut: placement new is refused by this compiler, so `vector` has no way to
construct an element in place and assigns into `calloc`'d memory instead. A
zeroed slot is therefore a real state for a `string` - null buffer, zero length,
zero capacity - and `reserve(0)` did nothing for one, leaving the
`buf_[len_] = 0` that follows every write to go to a null pointer.
`std::vector<std::string> s(2);` crashed for that and nothing else.

## A private nested type as a member's own return type

**[class.access]/6: a member's definition may name its class's private types**,
and the return type is written before the `C::` that says whose member it is.
`VM::Value VM::pop()` reads the type first, when nothing yet says this is a
member of VM - so `insideClass` answered no and the class was refused a
definition it had every right to write.

**The declarator ahead is asked instead**, which is the only thing that knows.
The scan stops at the first `(`, `;`, `{` or `=` at depth zero, so it cannot
wander past this declaration, and it takes the **longest run of `A::B::` that
names a type** - `Outer::Inner::f` asks about `Outer::Inner` rather than
stopping at `Outer`, which is the same longest-prefix rule `specifiers` already
follows. A class nested inside the owner counts, because its members reach the
owner's private names exactly as the owner's own do.

**What it must not do is let anyone else in**, and that is the half worth
testing: `VM::Value v;` in a function, `VM::Value other();` at file scope and
`sizeof(VM::Value)` are each still refused, and clang refuses all three too.
The look-ahead answers "is this the definition of a member of that class", not
"is that class mentioned nearby".

## `?:` as an lvalue, which was a missing shape rather than a missing rule

**[expr.cond]/4: a `?:` whose arms are glvalues of one type is a glvalue.** So
`int &r = p ? a : b;` is an ordinary reference binding, `(p ? a : b) = 20` an
ordinary assignment, and `&(p ? a : b)` an ordinary address. All three were
refused here from rung 2 on, and the refusal said the compiler could not build
one - which was true and unhelpful.

**The shape is the addresses.** `*(c ? &a : &b)` puts two pointers where the
arms were, which every backend already moves, and the dereference around them
is an lvalue: assignable, addressable, bindable. Nothing was added to any code
generator, which is the trade this file keeps recommending - where C++ adds a
*category*, look for an existing operation to lower it to.

**It is asked before the class lowering**, and that order is the whole of the
correctness. The class path copies both arms into a slot of its own; for two
lvalues of one type there is nothing to copy, and copying would take the
binding away again - `p ? x : y` would name a temporary rather than `x`, and
writing through the reference would reach nothing at all.

The types have to match exactly, cv-qualification included: a difference there
makes them different types, and [expr.cond]/5 sends those to the prvalue answer
the class lowering gives. What is left reaching the reference-binding path has
arms that are not both lvalues of one type, so its message says which of the
two rules applies rather than what the compiler cannot do.

## `long long` is a type of its own, and the streams had never heard of it

**`<ostream>` had insertions down to `unsigned long` and no further**, so a
64-bit value written through `<<` reached every arithmetic overload by a
conversion and none of them better than the rest. The call was ambiguous, and
the diagnostic listed seven candidates without naming the one that was
missing - which is the shape to remember, because a list of candidates answers
"which of these" when the question was "why is none of them right".

**On both Itanium targets `long` and `long long` are the same width**, which is
exactly why this was easy to miss: every value round-trips, every `sizeof`
agrees, and nothing looks wrong until overload resolution has to choose. They
are still distinct types, and [over.ics.scs] ranks a conversion between them
like any other.

A program that pins its own integer width writes this all day. Three of
Compiler++'s sixteen sources stopped here, all printing a `vmword` - which is
`long long` on everything but MSVC, where the same header spells it `__int64`.

The extraction pair went in with it, for the same reason: `in >> x` for a
`long long` lvalue had the same seven-way tie. `stream-long-long.cpp` runs a
value no `double` holds exactly and no 32-bit type holds at all, so a
conversion to any other overload would show.

## A converting constructor on `return`, and the `?:` that looked like its twin

**[stmt.return]/2 copy-initialises the returned object**, and a converting
constructor is part of that: `return "v";` from a function returning
`std::string` is `string("v")`. `userConversion` had done this for a by-value
argument since conversion functions landed, and `return` simply never reached
it - one call, two of Compiler++'s sixteen sources.

**`?:` looked like the same fix and is not.** Converting the arms the same way
made `c ? "_" : name` compile and then **abort at run time**, on three more
sources. A class-typed `?:` works here only where both arms are lvalues of one
type - `b ? s : t` - because `Conditional` yields a value the backends move as
a scalar, and a class needs storage of its own to be built into. Give either
arm a temporary and there is nowhere for the answer to live.

**So it is refused, and the refusal was made to say that.** It read
"incompatible types", which points at the arms when the problem is where the
result would go; it now names the rule and suggests an `if`. Compiling and
crashing is worse than refusing, and this is the one place today where the
difference between the two was a single `else` branch.

**It landed 2026-09-04, and it took three fixes in the order they had to
come.** The lowering was never the hard part: a frame slot for the result, each
arm building into it through `buildInto`, the conditional itself becoming the
`int` the arms answer with, and the expression wearing the `*(build, &tmp)`
shape `classTemporary` already produces.

**First, a guard is only as good as its initialisation.** The flags these
temporaries carry are cleared in front of the full expression by
`endFullExpression` - and a declaration never goes through it, flushing instead
through `flushTemporaries`, which runs *after* the statements it is destroying
for and cannot place anything in front of them. So on that path a guard held
whatever the frame did. They are cleared at the **function's entry** now, which
is the one place every path passes and which `flushTemporaries` does not need
to reach: cleared there and again as each object is destroyed, a guard is false
whenever its temporary does not exist.

**Then a temporary an arm made became that arm's alone.** One arm runs, so
destroying the other's temporaries is destroying objects that were never built
- `b ? take(T(5)) : take(T(9))` did, and `int r = ...` of that form ran two
destructors on slots nothing had written. Most temporaries are marked where
they are constructed; what needed `markArmTemporaries` is the object a *call*
returns, which cannot be marked there without wrapping the `Call` node the
elision paths find by `dynamic_cast`.

**And that turned up a live one, which is the find of the round.** `return
f();` for a class returned by value handed the caller the bytes in the result
slot *and* destroyed that slot at the end of the full expression - so the
caller received freed memory. `releaseTemporary` walks the expression to the
slot and a bare `Call` is not a `Var`, so it released nothing. It was
introduced by the commit that first registered a call's result as a temporary,
and no case saw it: `std::string::substr(pos, n)` is called directly
everywhere in the suite, and it is the one-argument `substr(pos)` - one line,
`return substr(pos, npos);` - that came back empty.

## Five walls out of Compiler++, and the shape they had in common

**macOS first, then Linux, then Windows** - and the reason that order costs
nothing is that every wall here was in `src/parser/`, which does not know what
machine it is compiling for. A front-end fix lands on all three at once; only
the ABI and the code generators differ, and 510 emit cases already walk those.

**A typedef at namespace scope was keyed by its bare name.** A class declared
there carried its namespace in its tag and was findable as `n::S`; a typedef
was registered as `sz` and so could be reached from inside the namespace, by
the walk in `findTypedef`, and never as `std::streamsize` written out - which
is how a program outside the namespace names it. Keyed by the qualified name
now, as everything else at that scope already was.

**A leading `::` works as a type and is still refused in an expression**, and
the split is not arbitrary. A type is one look in one table, and that table is
exactly the global scope by construction: a class at file scope is keyed by its
bare name, one in a namespace by its qualified name, one local to a function
lives in `localTypes_`. So `findGlobalTypedef` reaches the first and neither of
the others, and `::Lexer *lexer;` is that plus a token. A name in an expression
goes through `qualifyForLookup`, where a namespace and a using-directive get
their say - restricting that for one name means a flag put down again before
the call's arguments are parsed, and the half-built version *silently found
`cc::f` where the program asked for `::f`*. Measured, not guessed, which is why
it is refused rather than shipped.

**A redeclaration was looked up under a different key than the definition
registered.** `findGlobalToUpdate(d.name)` took the written name while the
registration below took `namespacePrefix() + d.name`, so a `cc::shared` beside
a global `shared` was reported as declared twice. One key, computed once.

**A `const T &` parameter took a user-defined conversion and not a standard
one.** [dcl.init.ref]/5 binds a const lvalue reference to a temporary
initialised by *any* implicit conversion sequence, and the reference binding's
rank is that sequence's rank. Only the user-defined half was here, so
`v.push_back(new Derived)` into a `vector<Base *>` and `v.assign(8, 0)` into a
`vector<unsigned char>` were both refused as no viable function - one a
pointer conversion, the other an integral one, neither of them exotic.

**And the library gaps were the rest**: `assign` and `swap` on `vector`, `swap`
on `map`, `strtol`, `strtoul`, `atof`, the one-character `find_first_of` and
`find_last_of` (the `const char *` forms were there and a `char` reaches them
through no conversion C++ has), and `rdbuf`.

**`ss << in.rdbuf()` is the whole reason a streambuf exists in most
programs**, and it is the one thing this library did not have a shape for. The
standard makes it a class with the buffering underneath; here the streams
buffer through `FILE *` already, so `rdbuf()` hands back a token naming the
stream it came from and the `operator<<` for it copies whatever is left. It is
deliberately not called `streambuf`: nothing else here takes one, and a class
with that name would promise the rest of the standard's interface.

**Found on the way and not fixed: inside a namespace, an unqualified name
finds the global one first.** `findTypedef` looks in the flat table before it
tries `qualifyForLookup`, so inside `namespace cc` a written `Lexer` is the
global `::Lexer` rather than `cc::Lexer` - the nearer scope should win. It is
recorded in `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` rather than mended here, because reversing
that order changes how every unqualified name in a namespace resolves and
wants a round of its own.

## A temporary during unwinding, and why the obvious fix is a regression

**Cleanup regions were built from `alive_`**, which is the list of objects with
names, and a temporary lives inside one full expression and is never in it. So
an argument copy and a class temporary were destroyed on the normal path and
leaked on the unwind - measured against clang with a throw through
`take(Owner(6))`, which ends with none alive there and two here.

**A pad covering the statement would have destroyed what the statement had not
built yet.** In `two(A(1), A(99))`, where the second constructor throws, it
would run `~A` on storage nothing constructed - a corruption in place of a
leak, which is the trade this tree refuses everywhere else. And the region
cannot begin after each construction instead: a `Try` wraps statements, and
that boundary is inside one.

**So each temporary carries a guard flag in the frame**, an int that is cleared
in front of the full expression, set the moment its constructor returns, and
cleared again as the object is destroyed - on the normal path and in the pad
alike. The pad destroys each temporary under its own flag, so one region covers
a whole statement and still destroys exactly what exists. It is MSVC's unwind
state variable written out by hand, and it needed nothing the AST did not
already have: `If`, `Assign` and `Comma`.

**Cleared in front of the expression, not once.** A statement inside a loop
runs again, and a flag left set from the turn before would have the pad destroy
an object this turn never built. `inLoop` in the case is there for that and
nothing else.

**And the pad clears as it destroys.** `_Unwind_Resume` carries on through the
enclosing regions of the same function, so a pad that destroyed without
clearing would be followed by one that destroyed the same object again - a
double free reached only by an exception, which no normal-path test could see.
The Windows funclets chain for the same reason and got the same treatment.

**The regions start at the top of the block now** rather than at the first
construction, because the first temporary can come before anything is alive and
would otherwise sit outside every region.

**Every temporary of the block is listed in every pad of it.** That reads
wasteful and is what makes it correct: the flag is what says which of them are
live at the point the exception left, so listing one that is not costs a test
and no more. Deciding *which* pad should carry which temporary would be the
statement-splitting this design exists to avoid.

**And a function body's regions reach back to its own by-value parameters.**
On Microsoft the callee destroys those, and `block()` bounded its regions at
what was alive when the body opened - which is *after* them. So an exception
leaving such a function destroyed everything but its parameters, on the one
target that owns them. `bodyCleanupFrom_` carries the earlier bound and only
the regions use it: the normal path already unwound them, through the `return`
and through the append that catches falling off the end.

**The one shape that stays broken is a Windows ABI question, not a design
gap.** Where an argument's constructor throws after an earlier argument was
copied into its parameter, nobody destroys that copy there: the caller does not
own it and the callee is never entered. Clearing the guard after the call
over-destroys instead - measured, because the callee's own regions destroy the
parameter on the way out and the caller's pad then does it again. Telling
"entered" from "not entered" is a state change at the call instruction, which
statement-granular regions cannot express. `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` records it and
the case names the shape rather than skipping it.

**The Windows answers here were measured in about fifteen seconds each**, not
by `verify-three`: the assembly is generated on the Mac, `scp`-ed to the box,
and assembled, linked and run there by a four-line `.cmd`. A full three-box run
rebuilds the compiler twice and answers one question in twenty minutes. Build
the short loop before the third question, not after the tenth.

**What is not covered is the object a call returns**, and the reason is
mechanical: setting a flag after the call means wrapping the `Call` node, and
both elision paths find their candidate by `dynamic_cast`-ing to it, so
wrapping would silently turn elision off. Elision routes that object into the
slot of whatever consumes it and those slots are guarded, so
`two(make(7), make(2))` balances; an un-elided result with a throw later in the
same expression does not. `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` records it, and the fix is a
field on `Call` plus a line in each code generator.

## `system()` is not a way to start a process, and one platform said so

**`-j` threaded the compiling and not the assembling.** `Driver::assembleObjects`
was a plain serial loop spawning one assembler per file, so sixteen sources
compiled in 0.08s on twelve cores and then took 1.9s to assemble one at a time -
the whole of why `cxx1 -c` lost to a parallel clang while winning every serial
comparison. It runs on the same work-stealing pool `runJobs` uses now, and so
does the Windows link path, which had its own copy of the loop.

**And on the Mac that bought nothing, which is the finding.** `-time` reported
"16 tool runs on 12 threads" and the wall clock did not move. `std::system` on
Apple's libc holds a global lock for the duration of the child, so concurrent
calls serialise completely. Measured, sixteen quarter-second sleeps issued from
eight threads:

| | measured | parallel floor | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS, Apple libc | 4260 ms | ~500 | serialised |
| Linux, glibc 2.34 | 530 ms | ~500 | parallel |
| Windows, MSVC CRT | 2105 ms | ~2000 | parallel |

**Asking all three is what made the answer right.** The machine to hand was the
one that behaves differently from the other two, and a conclusion drawn from it
alone - that parallel assembly does not help - would have been wrong about two
platforms and wrong about the cause on the third. This is the house rule about
one target being correct and another not, arriving through the C library rather
than through a code generator.

**`posix_spawn` and `waitpid` in place of `std::system`, on the POSIX path
only.** The status is the one `waitpid` gives, so every caller's `!= 0` test is
unchanged; Windows keeps `system()`, which measured parallel. `environ` comes
from `_NSGetEnviron()` on Apple and from the plain symbol elsewhere.

**What is deliberately not copied is `system()`'s signal handling.** It ignores
SIGINT in the parent while the child runs; for a compiler driver a Ctrl-C should
stop the whole compile rather than one assembler.

**Source to object, Compiler++'s sixteen sources, before and after:**

| | before | after | the platform's own |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M4 Pro, -j12 | 2.19 | **0.50** | clang 0.81 |
| i7-12700, -j8 | 1.16 | **0.29** | cl 0.94 |
| Xeon, -j2 | 1.37 | 1.20 | g++ 6.69 |

The Xeon's small gain is the machine rather than the change: its two vCPUs are
hyperthread siblings of one physical core, and g++ itself gets only 1.16x from
the second. The Mac's 0.50 is 0.08 compiling plus 0.42 assembling, within a hair
of the 0.45s the same files took through `xargs -P12` - which is what said the
ceiling had been the library and not the work.

**The pool also closed a race it would otherwise have opened.** The command
named in an assembler error was one file-scope string several threads would have
written at once. It is `thread_local` now, with the failing worker copying it out
under a lock - and the **first failure by index** is reported rather than
whichever thread lost the race, so a rerun blames the same file.

`docs/benchmark-2026-09-05.html` is the measured record, and like the audit it is
frozen rather than edited as things change.

## An 8 MB stack on Windows, which is what the other two targets always had

**The last of Compiler++'s 200 comparisons was a stack overflow, not a
miscompilation.** `124_err_nested_too_deeply` feeds the compiler an expression
twenty thousand terms deep, and the point of the case is that the compiler
*refuses* it - "expression nested too deeply" - rather than dying. On Linux and
macOS it does; on Windows cxx1's build of Compiler++ crashed first, because
Windows reserves a 1 MB stack by default where ELF and Mach-O reserve 8, and
cxx1's frames are large - `analyzeExprImpl` is about 12 KB, since every local
and every by-value temporary gets its own slot. A recursive walk over a deep
tree exhausted 1 MB before the depth cap fired.

**So the linked program gets an 8 MB stack, which is Linux's own default.** One
line on the Windows link - `/stack:8388608` in `Driver::link` - and the program
behaves the same on every target rather than differently on the one with the
small default. It is parity, not a workaround: the source refuses deep nesting
identically everywhere, and only the OS's default stack had differed. Measured
against cl, which survives the same input because its frames are smaller;
`docs/` records that a real fix - frame-slot reuse in cxx1's code generator, so
dead slots are recycled and frames shrink on every target - is a separate and
much larger piece, worth doing on its own account rather than to close one
pathological case.

**Compiler++ now matches a cl build on all 200 comparisons.** It compiles,
assembles, links and runs correctly under cxx1 on x86_64-linux, arm64-darwin
and x86_64-windows - 200 of 200 on each, byte-identical to a clang, g++ or cl
build of the same sources. The whole undertaking that this file has recorded
since "A base's members were built twice" is finished.

## A static member defined out of line is worth its value when read

**[expr.const]/3 makes a const object of integral type a constant expression
when it is read**, and every compiler folds a const *floating* one the same
way even though the letter of C++11 does not - which is what let Vincenty's
`const double b = (1 - f) * a;` compile. That read-back was taught to `Local`
and to `GlobalSym`, and a **static data member is in neither**: it is kept in
`Type::StaticMember`, deliberately apart from `members()` so that nothing
walking a layout has to learn to skip it, and it never enters `globals_`.

So the same three lines one door over were refused:

```cpp
struct S { static const double k; };
const double S::k = 2.5;
const double t = S::k * 2.0;   // expected a constant initialiser
```

**The integral twin was refused too, and harder** - `const int S::n = 4;` then
`int a[S::n];` was *"expected an array length"*, which is [expr.const]/3's own
ground. What worked was every shape that does not need a constant: the same
member read in a local, or inside a member function, and the in-class
`static const int k = 5;`, which is `folded` on the StaticMember and has no
storage at all. One missing lookup, two evaluators.

**Keyed by the linkage symbol and not by the written name.** A base's static
member may be named through a derived class - `Derived::k` for `S`'s - and
`staticMemberRef` builds the `Var` with the name as written while the symbol
is the same object either way. `staticConsts_` is a parser table beside
`defaultArgs_`, which is keyed the same way and for the same reason; the
alternative was a `const_cast` into `Type`, whose `cls()` is const by design
after the findMember bug.

**The object still has storage and an address**, which is the whole difference
from `folded`: only what it is worth when read is answered here, and
`&S::k` is unchanged. The case takes those addresses for a second reason -
clang folds a const every reader of which is a constant expression and emits
no symbol, so without them the names suite reports symbols cxx1 has and clang
has not, which is a question about emission wearing the shape of a mangling
bug. That is the third time this file has had to say so.

**Found by walking one door over from a fix that passed everything.** The
floating read-back had its own case, the whole suite was green on three
boxes, and it compiled the real program it was written for. Six lines written
ten minutes later found the neighbour it missed, and then a probe of the
*definition's* spellings found one more.

**`static` on the definition is refused now**, and it was accepted before.
[class.static.data]/2 puts the keyword on the declaration inside the class:
at namespace scope it would give the object internal linkage, which the
member it defines cannot have, so `static double S::x = 0;` says two things
at once. clang refuses it; cxx1 defined the object and dropped the keyword.
It is not an exclusion - this is code C++11 itself forbids, so it belongs in
neither `EXCLUSIONS.md` nor `CONFORMANCE.md`, and the site count stays 105.

Fifteen shapes measured against clang, all agreeing, in
`tests/cases/static-member-const-folds.cpp` and
`static-member-static-refused.cpp`. The emit golden reports **0 of 627 files
changed**, so nothing that compiled before is emitted differently.

## A static member has no `this`, and one line of Compiler++ was that

**The call-with-arguments fault was a static member function returning a class
by value.** `SemanticAnalyzer::parameterText` is `static std::string
parameterText(Function *, size_t)`, and the definition side decided whether a
function has a `this` from the *qualifier* alone - `A::f` is a member,
therefore it has one - which is true of every member but the static ones. A-01
put the hidden return pointer *after* `this` on the Microsoft ABI; a function
believed to have a `this` it does not have then looks for that pointer in the
second slot while every caller puts it in the first, and writes its result
through whatever the first argument was. Here that was a `cc::Function *`, and
the string's length landed on its `retType` - which is why the next
`dynamic_cast` on that field read address 0x11.

**Invisible on Itanium**, where the hidden pointer is first whether or not
there is a `this`, and invisible to every existing case: the emit golden
reports 0 of 570 changed by the fix, which says no case had a static member
returning a class by value. `static-member-returns-class.cpp` does now, with a
guard object the stray write would land on, and `run-cases.cmd` checks its
output on the box that owns the ABI.

**How it was found, in order, because the order is the lesson.** A vectored
exception handler compiled by cl and linked beside cxx1's objects - it shares
no `std::` with them - printed the fault: `__RTDynamicCast` with `rcx = 0x11`,
so the *object* was bad and the RTTI records I had just ported were not.
Then a global watch pointer at `&fn->retType`, printed after every statement
in a copy of Compiler++, walked it down: fine after `checkCallArgs`'s
argument analysis, fine after `convertible`, corrupt after `warnIfNarrowing` -
then fine at every statement *inside* `warnIfNarrowing`, so the damage was in
building its arguments - then `parameterText` was fine through its whole body
and corrupt on return. Static was the one word left. Four probes of the
obvious shapes had all passed first, which is the reminder that a probe is a
hypothesis and the watch is the oracle.

**127 of Compiler++'s 200 comparisons on Windows were this one line**: 30 to
157 identical. The 43 that remain are the next round.

## Windows EH in GNU syntax, and Compiler++ links

**It links.** Sixteen objects, no `/FORCE:MULTIPLE`, no duplicate and no
unresolved symbol, and the MASM path untouched - the emit golden reports **0 of
570 files changed** through every step below, which is what says ELF, Mach-O and
ml64 all still emit exactly what they did.

**`.seh_*` does most of it, and cannot do the part COMDAT exists for.** clang's
COFF assembler builds `.pdata` and `.xdata` from the directives - measured, a
function carrying them came out with a 0x14-byte .xdata and a 0xc-byte .pdata
cxx1 wrote no byte of - which would have removed the whole hand-written unwind
schedule, the part that took four attempts on the MASM side. It refuses inside a
COMDAT section: `.seh_handlerdata` in `.text,"xr",discard,"sym"` is *expected
relocatable expression*, and in a uniquely-named variant too. Every inline
definition is such a section and an inline member with a destructor carries EH,
so the shortcut fails for exactly the functions COMDAT is for. Written out into
`associative` sections it assembles, so the codes are MASM's arithmetic in GNU
spelling after all.

**Two properties were living in the MASM subclass that belong to the target**,
and both were found by walking into them:

- `usesFunclets()` - the GNU path walked a *Microsoft* `try` down the Itanium
  branch and dereferenced a landing pad that is null by construction.
- `localsAboveFrameBase()` - the epilogue restored `rsp` to the bottom of the
  frame and `pop rbp` read the wrong word, so any call crashed.

**Four things the linker taught, each one an error message:**

- **A table cannot name an `.L` temporary.** Rewritten to a real symbol exactly
  as the MASM spelling rewrites it, dots to underscores. The same rule the
  Itanium LSDA already needed `GCC_except_table0` for.
- **`.pdata` has to be sorted and funclets break the order** - LNK1223, the same
  trap and the same answer as MASM: the funclets' entries go in a pile written
  after every function.
- **A funclet of a mergeable parent is mergeable with it.** `associative` says
  "discard this with that one", so the funclet and its unwind data go wherever
  the parent's copy goes.
- **A funclet is not `.globl`.** Nothing outside the object names one - the
  tables that point at it sit beside it - and exporting one made every unit
  holding a copy collide. MASM avoids it by leaving them out of its PUBLIC list.

**The RTTI records had to come across too**, and they are the same five objects
with `.long X@IMGREL` where MASM writes `DD imagerel X`. `emitsOwnRtti()` keeps
the MASM path from emitting a second set: both reach the base `run()`, and the
first attempt wrote them twice, which the golden caught at once - 20 of 570
changed.

**What this does not fix**, and it is the next wall: the linked program faults
on a call *with arguments* - `f()` is fine, `f(1)` exits `0xE06D7363`, an
unhandled C++ exception, which on this target means `operator new` was handed a
bad size. 30 of Compiler++'s 200 comparisons pass, and they are the ones calling
nothing with arguments. It predates all of this - the `/FORCE:MULTIPLE` build
failed identically, and so does the MASM build - so it is a Windows code
generation bug rather than anything about linking.

## COMDAT: ml64 makes COFF and cannot mark it, and the way round is one layer deeper

**The object format was never the problem, which is worth measuring before
reasoning.** `ml64` emits COFF and nothing else - version 14.44 offers no
object-format switch at all, only `/Fo` to name the file, and `dumpbin` reports
`8664 machine (x64)` on its output, which MS `link` consumes. What it cannot do
is set `IMAGE_SCN_LNK_COMDAT` on a section. Side by side on the same machine:

    ml64's object   SECTION HEADER #1..#3     no COMDAT on any
    cl's object     SECTION HEADER #3           COMDAT; sym= "?get@S@@QEBAHXZ"
                    SECTION HEADER #4           COMDAT; sym= "?use@@YAHXZ"

`_TEXT$x SEGMENT ALIGN(16) 'CODE' COMDAT` is refused as an unknown attribute,
not as an unsupported format.

**Withdrawing the PUBLIC links and costs too much.** The other half of the same
idea is expressible - let every object keep the copy it emitted - and it does
link, once a second gap is closed: `??_G` has no `Signature`, so A-02's
`markSymbolUsed` at vtable emission is a no-op for it and it was synthesised
only beside the destructor's own definition, leaving other units naming a
symbol they never defined. With both halves the sixteen objects of Compiler++
link with no duplicates and no unresolved symbols. **And `names vs cl` falls
from 138 agreed / 0 differed to 87 / 51**, every difference one-directional -
cl exports what cxx1 no longer does, vtables included, so each unit would carry
its own. That suite exists to catch exactly this: its comment records the
`OPTION PROC:PRIVATE` bug as *"the names were right and it was the storage
class beside them that was wrong"*. Writing 51 `.nocl` files would be
suppressing the only oracle that noticed. The patch is not taken.

**The way round is the assembler.** clang emits the same COFF and can set the
bit, so `-masm=gnu` plus `clang -target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -c` is the
route. Measured before building anything: a Microsoft name is not a GNU
identifier and has to be **quoted**, `.cfi_*` is accepted for COFF, and two
objects each defining `?inl@@YAHXZ` in `.section .text,"xr",discard,"?inl@@YAHXZ"`
link and fold and the program returns 9.

**`CoffSpelling` is that, and it is additive by construction.** `GnuSpelling`
is shared with the two targets carrying the Compiler++ result, so the change is
a `sym()` hook that answers with the name unchanged and a `mergeable` flag on
`functionBegin` that the existing spelling ignores. The claim that nothing
moved is not an assertion: the emit golden was recorded before the work and
reports **0 of 570 files changed** after it.

### And the route is blocked one layer deeper than COMDAT

**`-masm=gnu` for x86_64-windows crashed on any real program, and did so
before this work** - checked by stashing and rebuilding. `usesFunclets()` was
true in the MASM spelling alone, so this generator walked a *Microsoft* `try`
down the Itanium branch and dereferenced a landing pad that is null by
construction. The exception model is a property of the target and not of the
spelling, and it says so now.

**Fixing the branch is what shows the size of it.** The Microsoft model wants a
funclet per handler with the FH3 tables and hand-written `.pdata`/`.xdata`
beside them, and `beginFunclet`, `endCleanupFunclet` and `storeUnwindHelp` are
implemented in `Masm.cpp` and nowhere else. Compiler++ has classes with
destructors, so cxx1 emits cleanup funclets for it and there is no path round.
Finishing this route means re-spelling the whole Windows exception backend in
GNU syntax - the size of rung 6.5b, which took four steps.

**So it refuses by name rather than crashing**, which is the standing rule
applied to a mode nothing exercised: *"a 'try' or an object with a destructor
needs a funclet on x86_64-windows, and the GNU spelling does not write one yet
- use -masm=masm for this file"*. What is committed is the foundation and that
diagnostic; Windows linking now waits on Windows EH in GNU syntax rather than
on COMDAT.

## Compiler++ on Windows: three faults found, and the one wall left

**The Mac writes the MASM and the box only assembles it.** There is no cxx1 on
the Windows machine for this: the front end is shared and the code generator is
reachable from anywhere with `-arch`, so sixteen `.asm` files go over and ml64
and link do the rest. That is `tools/windows/asm-run.cmd`'s trade at sixteen
files instead of one, and it turns a twenty-minute round into a two-minute one.

**A symbol named by data is a use, and MASM needs it declared.** `referenced_`
was filled from the two *operand* paths, so an EXTERN was written for everything
a call mentions and for nothing a `DQ` does. A vtable slot holding a function
defined in another translation unit reached ml64 undeclared - `error A2006:
undefined symbol` - on ten of Compiler++'s sixteen and on nothing in the suite,
where every class is defined where it is used. It is the mirror of A-02: there a
vtable slot was a use nothing emitted, here a use nothing declared.

**And then the same thing from the other side.** With data recording a
reference, the four RTTI objects a vtable names - the locator, the hierarchy,
the base array, the base descriptor - were declared EXTERN *and* defined a few
lines below, which ml64 calls a symbol redefinition. `MasmCodeGen::run`
predefined the descriptor alone, that being the only one a `lea` had ever
mentioned. All five now.

**A forward declaration carries its class key, and cxx1 dropped it.**
[dcl.type.elab] lets `class D;` and `struct D;` declare one entity and lets a
program mix them; the Microsoft ABI writes **V** for a class and **U** for a
struct, so the two spellings are two symbols. cxx1 recorded the keyword only at
the *definition* - right for a diagnostic, wrong for a name - so a unit seeing
only `class Diagnostics;` wrote U where the defining unit wrote V, and they did
not link. A declaration records it now when no definition has, and a definition
still wins, which is what keeps `class X;` and `struct X { }` one type.

**No single-file suite could have found it.** Every case compiles alone, where
both spellings agree with themselves; it takes two translation units of one
program. `tests/cases/forward-declared-class-key.cpp` is the case, and what
holds it is `names.sh` comparing `?f@@YAHAEAVD@@@Z` against clang.

**The scrape had to stop reading an EXTERN as a symbol.** MASM needs every name
a `DQ` mentions declared and the GNU spelling needs nothing, and
`tools/mangled-names` has no rule for a `.quad` operand - so `_purecall` in a
vtable became a name on one side and nothing on the other. Call targets are
still compared, from the `call` lines, on both sides.

### The wall: ml64 cannot say COMDAT

**All sixteen assemble and the link is the only thing left.** What collides is
every inline and template member: `vector<unsigned char>::push_back`,
`ostringstream::~ostringstream`, and so on, each emitted in every translation
unit that uses it. [dcl.inline]/6 allows exactly that and leaves the linker to
fold the copies - `.weak` on ELF, `.weak_def_can_be_hidden` on Mach-O, and on
Windows a COMDAT section, which **ml64 has no directive for at all**. cl's own
listing marks these `; COMDAT`, which is its object writer talking rather than
anything assemblable.

**Both pure answers were tried and both fail.** Keeping every copy PUBLIC is
what happens today: `LNK2005`, six of them. Withdrawing the PUBLIC so each
object keeps its own copy - the only thing MASM *can* express - links those and
then leaves **19 unresolved `??_G` deleting destructors**, because a unit that
emits a vtable naming one does not always emit the function. So the two
requirements are "define it everywhere" and "export it nowhere", and cxx1
satisfies neither completely.

**What would settle it**, in the order they are worth trying: a COFF-capable
assembler on the box, since cxx1 already has `-masm=gnu` and clang writes
`.section .text,"xr",discard,"<symbol>"` for exactly this - measured, and the
box has no clang today; or emitting every vtable slot's function in every unit
that emits the table, which makes "define everywhere" true and lets the PUBLIC
be withdrawn; or a key-function scheme, which is a design this compiler does not
have. `/FORCE:MULTIPLE` links and runs and is a diagnostic, not a fix - it says
the COMDAT is the only wall left, and it was used to establish exactly that.

## A temporary made after the full expression ended, and the function it leaked into

**`endFullExpression` empties `pendingTemps_`, and the return path pushed onto
it afterwards.** [stmt.return]/2 copy-initialises the returned object, so
`return "<type>";` from a function returning a class calls a converting
constructor - and `userConversion` was applied *below* the flush. The temporary
it made was registered for destruction on a list nothing would empty again: it
survived the end of the function and was still there when the **next function**
was parsed, which duly emitted a guarded destructor call for a frame slot of a
frame that no longer existed.

**Compiler++ has that pair verbatim.** `Semantic.cpp`'s `describe` ends
`return "<type>";` and `countText` is the next function in the file, so
`countText` began with

    call _ZNSt13ostringstreamC2Ev     ; construct ss
    lea  -0x414(%rbp),%rax            ; a guard belonging to describe
    movslq (%rax),%rax
    cmp  $0x0,%rax
    je   ...                          ; skip if it happens to be clear
    lea  -0x410(%rbp),%rax
    call _ZNSt6stringD2Ev             ; ~string on whatever is there

- and on x86_64-linux `free` was handed a pointer into the source text about a
quarter of the time. `rdi` at the fault read `0x2c32202c31286464`, which is the
ASCII of `dd(1, 2,` - the giveaway that the address was text rather than an
object.

**The fix is an ordering, not a mechanism**: convert before the full expression
ends. That also puts the temporary where `releaseTemporary` can see it, which
is what it wants - the converted object *is* what the caller receives, so its
bytes are handed over rather than destroyed here, which is the same rule
`return f();` needed.

**The two boxes disagreed about how bad it was, and that is the lesson.** On
macOS the stale guard reads a clean zero, the destructor is skipped, and the
only symptom is one leaked object - `tests/cases/return-conversion-leaks-temporary.cpp`
prints `live 2` where clang prints `live 1`. On x86_64-linux the same slot holds
whatever the frame held and it segfaults, intermittently, 8 runs in 30. Four
green suites and 200 of 200 Compiler++ comparisons on the Mac did not see it;
building Compiler++ on the Linux box is what did. **The case dirties the frame
before calling** for exactly this reason - on a clean stack the wrong code
passes.

**How it was found**: `coredumpctl debug` for a backtrace with line numbers,
because gdb disables ASLR and the bug then never fires under it - 25 runs under
gdb, no crash, then a core from an ordinary run named `Semantic.cpp:244` at
once. `set disable-randomization off` is the other way in. Then disassembling
the named line turned "corruption somewhere" into a guard test the source has
no `?:` and no `&&` to explain, which is what said the entry came from another
function.

**Recorded rather than fixed, and beside this because it was found here:**
`bindReference` materialises a const-reference temporary with a bytewise
`Assign` rather than the copy constructor, so a class prvalue bound to
`const T &` is shallow-copied into a slot that is then never destroyed. It is a
wasted slot today rather than a fault - the source temporary is still destroyed
exactly once - but it is the wrong lowering, and [dcl.init.ref]/5 asks for no
copy at all: the prvalue is materialised and the reference binds to *it*.

## The operand `&&` skipped, and the destructor it was owed anyway

**A temporary built in the right operand of `&&` or `||` was destroyed even
when the operand never ran.** [expr.log.and]/1 evaluates the second operand
only if the first is true, so an object it would have made was never made - and
the destructor the full expression owes at its end is owed for nothing. cxx1
ran it regardless, on a frame slot holding whatever the stack had left there:
for `std::string` that is `free` of a stack address, which GuardMalloc reports
and an ordinary run turns into a segfault three passes later.

**This is what stood between cxx1 and Compiler++**, and it was one line of
ordinary C++11:

```cpp
if (cl->vtable[s]->name == m->name &&
    mangleSignature(cl->vtable[s]->params) == want) { ... }
```

The left half is false for most entries, so `mangleSignature` - which returns a
`std::string` by value, into a slot of the caller's frame - is skipped, and the
slot is destroyed all the same. It is reachable from three lines of C++:
`class B : public A` with a virtual function each, and `b.g()` on a named
object, which is the one path that asks for the final override by signature.

**The guard a `?:` arm already carried is the whole fix**, and the machinery
was there: a temporary with a destructor gets a flag in the frame, cleared in
front of the full expression, set where the object comes into being, and read
by the destruction at the end and by the pad alike. `markArmTemporaries` sets
it at the end of an arm; `markSkippableTemporaries` does the same for an
operand that may be jumped over.

**One difference, and it decides the shape.** A `?:` arm's value is an int the
conditional discards, so the guard can simply follow it - `Comma(arm, set)`
answers with the guard. An `&&` operand's value is what the comparison reads,
so the same shape would make every taken branch true. The operand is kept in a
slot of its own, the guards are set, and the slot is handed back:
`(($sc = r), $g1 = 1, ..., $sc)`.

**How it was found, and what did not find it.** Four suites green on three
boxes, and 128 of Compiler++'s 129 cases byte-identical to a clang build of the
same sources. What found it was `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib`
- GuardMalloc turns the corruption into a report at the moment of the bad free
rather than a fault somewhere else - plus `br set -n malloc_error_break` for the
backtrace, which named `std::string::~string()` inside one function. Two
`fprintf` calls added to that function made the bug vanish, which is what said
it was heap corruption rather than a wrong pointer. Reading the emitted
assembly for the named function is what turned "corruption somewhere" into the
`beq` that skips a construction and the `bl __ZNSt6stringD1Ev` after it that
does not skip the destruction.

**The case counts live objects and whether the operand ran**, never
constructor calls - CLAUDE.md's standing rule, and both halves matter here:
elision may change how many copies happen and may not change how many objects
exist, nor whether a skipped operand was evaluated.
`tests/cases/temporary-in-short-circuit.cpp`, measured against clang for both
operators, both outcomes, a nested `&&` inside a skipped operand, and an
operand whose value decides the branch. Its members are defined **out of
line**: written inside the class they are inline, clang emits none of them, and
the names suite would then report a difference about emission rather than
mangling - the trap this file already records twice. What is left is a
`.nonames` for arm64-darwin alone, where cxx1 emits the `__Unwind_Resume` of a
cleanup pad clang has no temporary to need.

## A class returned by value was never destroyed, and the two halves that hid it

**One object leaked per call**, in every shape a call's result can appear in:
`make();` discarded, `make().v`, `T b = make();`, `T b(make())`, and
`take(make())`. It was reported as a double destroy and measured as the
opposite - which is the whole reason to count live objects rather than read
printed lines. `Guard g = Guard(5);` printing two destructors for one
constructor is **not** a fault: it is the legal non-eliding option, and
`clang -fno-elide-constructors` prints exactly what cxx1 prints. The fault was
next door and had the other sign.

**The caller never owned the result slot.** `completeCall` allocates a frame
slot for a class return - it is where the callee builds through the hidden
pointer - and nothing was destroying it. It goes on `pendingTemps_` now like
any other temporary, so the full expression ends it. What that needs beside it
is a way to *give it up*: `claimCallResult` takes the entry back off wherever
something redirects the result into storage of its own - the copy elision in a
declaration, and the argument-copy elision in `materialiseCopy`. Without that
the destructor would run on a slot nothing ever built, which is worse than
the leak.

**And the callee copied what it had already given away.** `return Owner(n);`
releases the temporary rather than destroying it - correctly, because its bytes
travel out through the hidden pointer and the caller owns them from that
moment. But the branch below it, which exists so that returning a glvalue this
function does not own calls the copy constructor, could not tell that case from
a released temporary: it built a second object and left the first undestroyed.
`releaseTemporary` answers whether it found one now, and a released temporary
*is* the object going out.

**The elision had to widen, and the reason is the point.** The gate asked
`nonTrivialCopy()`, so a class of plain members with a `~T` - trivial to copy,
observable to destroy - was copied rather than elided. Once the result slot was
being destroyed properly that showed up as two destructions where clang has
one, in three existing cases. Both readings are legal; matching the oracle is
worth more. **A destructor makes the copy observable even where the copy
itself is trivial**, and that is what the gate asks now.

**Found beside it and not fixed: a temporary is not destroyed when an
exception passes through.** Cleanup regions are built from `alive_`, which
holds named objects; `pendingTemps_` has no region of its own, so an argument
copy or a class temporary is destroyed on the normal path and leaked on the
unwind. Measured with a throw through `take(Owner(6))` - clang balances,
cxx1 leaves two alive - and it is pre-existing rather than opened by this
change: it needs cleanup regions built from the temporaries list, which is
real machinery and its own step. `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` records it.

**`return-by-value-balance.cpp` counts live objects and whether constructions
balance destructions, and never the number of constructor calls.** Elision is
permitted rather than required in C++11 and the two oracles take different
options, so a constructor count has no single right answer - while a leak or a
double destroy moves those two numbers and nothing else does. That is the
shape CLAUDE.md already prescribed for `return-copy-balance` and `move-only`,
and this is the case family it said was missing.

## A declaration in a condition, and the two rules that are not one rule

**`if (T x = e)` was deferred at rung 1** with the note that it "needs the
condition's scope to wrap both branches, which is a change to how `If` is built
rather than an addition to it". That was the right description and it is what
the fix turned out to be: the statement goes inside a `Block` of its own -
which already carries a scope - with the declaration hoisted in front of the
`If` and the destructors after it. Three of Compiler++'s sixteen sources were
stopped by it, all writing the same line: `if (cc::ArrayType *at =
dynamic_cast<cc::ArrayType*>(t))`.

**The `if` form and the `while` form are different rules, and reading them as
one is how to get this silently wrong.** [stmt.select]/2 evaluates the
condition of an `if` once, so hoisting is exact. [stmt.iter]/2 creates and
destroys the loop variable **on every turn** - so hoisting a `while`'s
initialiser would evaluate it once and then loop for ever on the value it got.
`while (int *p = pull())` is the shape that shows it, and it is an infinite
loop rather than a wrong number.

So the `while` form declares the slot once - it is one object as far as the
frame is concerned - and **moves the initialisation into the condition**,
`(x = e)`, which is what the standard asks for as long as there is no
constructor or destructor to run. A class there is refused by name, and that
refusal is the honest edge of this: it would need its constructor written where
the test is.

**The `if` form gets full generality for free**, because it goes through
`declarationBody` rather than through a second declaration parser. One flag
tells that function's tail that the `)` is the caller's and that a condition
declares one name; everything above the tail - `auto`, a class with a
constructor, the copy elision, the `alive_` bookkeeping - is the path an
ordinary declaration already took. **The tail is one place and the loop is
not**: the class branch leaves the declarator loop by `break` rather than by
falling out of it, so the check that was first written inside the loop was
skipped by exactly the declarations that needed it most.

**And the names suite found the half that was missing.** `tests/names.sh`
reported that clang emitted `_Unwind_Resume` for a function with a
condition-declared object and cxx1 did not - which reads as a naming difference
and was a missing cleanup region. The normal-path destructors run where the
statement ends, and unwinding does not go that way: an exception through either
arm would have left the object undestroyed. The condition's object needs the
same `built` record a block keeps for what it constructs, in the same shape -
a statement index and how many were alive after it.
`tests/cases/condition-declaration-unwind.cpp` runs it and the destructor
fires.

**Found on the way, and not fixed here: `Guard g = Guard(5);` destroys twice.**
One construction, two destructions - the temporary is elided into `g`'s storage
and then both are on `alive_`. It has nothing to do with conditions; it is an
ordinary declaration initialised by a class temporary, and for a class that
owns anything it is a double free. Recorded rather than mended in the same
change, because it is a different subject and wants a case family of its own.

## `mutable`, three lines and one exception that was already there

**[dcl.stc]/9 makes a `mutable` member writable through a const object**, which
is what a class reaches for when something it caches or counts is not part of
the value it presents. It was refused with "'mutable' is implemented, but not
where a type was wanted" - implemented on a lambda, and nowhere else - and one
`mutable bool` in one header stopped five of Compiler++'s sixteen sources.

**The propagation was already in one shape at each of the three places a member
is reached**, which is why the fix is three lines rather than a design. `.`,
`->`, and the implicit `this->name` inside a member function each ask whether
the object is const and qualify the member's type if it is - and each already
carried one exception, the reference member whose referent [dcl.ref] does not
reach. A mutable member is the second exception in the same condition.

**It is a property of the member and not of its type**, so the flag sits on
`Member` beside the access and the bit-field width, not in the qualifiers.
Putting it in the type would have made `mutable int` a type distinct from
`int`, which would reach the mangler - and neither ABI spells it, because the
keyword changes no name and no layout.

**The four things it may not be applied to are refused by name**, and each is a
contradiction rather than a gap: a static member is not part of any object, a
const one is what the keyword exists to undo, a reference cannot be rebound
whatever is said about it, and a function is not a member that is written.
clang refuses all four and so does this.

**Written after the type - `int mutable x;`, which is legal and nobody writes -
it is still refused**, by the keyword table with the message that keyword
already had. The specifier is read before `specifiers()` in the member loop,
which is one place rather than a fifth spelling inside a function that answers
about types.

## An enumeration inside a class or a namespace, and the three things it wanted

**`enum Kind { Red, Green };` written in a class body was refused with "this
declares nothing - a member needs a name"**, which is a message about a member
declaration answering a question about a type declaration. It is the ordinary
way C++ spells a small set of named constants, so this shut a door most
programs go through - five of Compiler++'s sixteen sources among them - and it
was not on any refusal list, because nothing refused it *by name*.

**Three things were missing at once and each was in a different file**, which
is why it read as one wall rather than three.

**The declaration.** In a class body `enum Kind { ... };` declares a type and
no member, exactly as a nested class does - and it is told apart by the
**keyword**, not by what the specifier answers with. A nested class is
recognised at the semicolon by the type being a struct with a tag; an
enumeration answers `int`, and there is nothing in an `int` to recognise. So
the member loop records whether the specifier started at `enum` before it
reads one.

**The name.** The tag and every enumerator take the enclosing class's tag or
the namespace prefix - `C::Kind`, `C::Red`, `n::Level`, `n::Low` - which is the
same qualified-string key a nested class already uses. Without it two classes
could not each write `Red`, and a class's enumerator collided with a global of
that name.

**And the lookup, which is a walk rather than one flat map.** `enums_` was
keyed by the written name and read by one `find`, so a prefixed enumerator was
findable only by its full name. `findEnum` now tries the flat map, then
`qualifyForLookup` for the namespaces, then `classStack_`, `currentClass_` and
`inlineOwner_` - which is the order every other name in this parser is looked
up in, and it is what makes `Green` mean `C::Green` inside a member of C and
nowhere else. `enumInClass` is the per-class half, written to mirror
`lookupInClass` so the two cannot drift.

**A qualified enumerator needed a fourth place, and it is not where the
namespace one lives.** `n::Low` is read by the namespace branch of `primary`,
which is guarded on `namespaces_` and never sees a class. `C::Red` goes to the
branch below it - the one that finds a static data member by the longest
prefix that names a class and has such a member - and it now makes the same
walk one step over for an enumerator. A value and not an object, so there is
nothing to take the address of and the number is the whole of it.

**An enumeration is still `int`, and this did not change that.**
`docs/CONFORMANCE.md` records it, and it is visible in the mangling: cxx1
spells `n::twice(Level)` as `_ZN1n5twiceEi` where clang writes
`_ZN1n5twiceENS_5LevelE`, and `?twice@n@@YAHH@Z` against `?twice@n@@YAHW4Level@1@@Z`.
`tests/cases/nested-enum.nonames` records that for all three targets. Giving an
enumeration a type of its own is a separate step, and it changes the name of
every function that takes one.

## Ordinary C++ this refuses, and none of it is on the ladder

**The gap this section exists to close.** `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` holds what
compiles and is wrong, and the ladder holds the features not written yet -
each of which is refused *by name*, so a reader who reaches for one is told
which one. Between the two there is a third kind, and it had no home: small
pieces of perfectly ordinary C++ that are refused by a message about something
else, belonging to no rung and named nowhere. They are invisible until
somebody writes one, which is how all three below were found - by running
plain C++ past the compiler and reading what came back, rather than by
reading the ladder.

Found 2026-08-30 and each checked against clang, which accepts all three.

| written | what comes back |
| --- | --- |
| `P a(1), b(2);` | `expected ';'` — **fixed 2026-09-04**, and it was never about the arguments: see below |
| `return P(1);` | `'P(...)' makes a temporary of type 'struct P'` — a class temporary written as a functional cast |
| `int f(int) { … }` | `a parameter of a definition needs a name` - **fixed 2026-09-04** |

**The third had a sharper edge than it looks, and it is mended.** The postfix
increment is declared `operator++(int)` and *nobody names that parameter* - it
exists only to tell the two forms apart, so every real program writing one hit
this. The prototype form was accepted and only the definition refused, which
is the inherited C rule: a body needs a name to refer to the parameter by. C++
does not require one, and a compiler that means to run other people's code has
to take it.

**An unnamed parameter still occupies a slot and a place in the calling
convention**, which is why skipping it was not an option and giving it `off =
0` would have put it on top of the frame's first word. It is declared under a
name no program can write - `$unnamed<n>` - and everything below that point is
the named path unchanged: the frame slot, the calling convention, and on
Windows the `alive_` entry that destroys a by-value class parameter. The same
device the lambda return typedef and a pack's members already used. Four of
Compiler++'s sixteen sources were stopped by it.

**The second is what a constructor is usually written through**, so it is the
one most likely to stop a real program: `return P(1);`, `f(P(1))` and
`P p = P(1);` are all it. What it needs is a materialised temporary with a
lifetime, which is also what `static_cast<T &&>` of a prvalue wants - see rung
7.4b, where that was refused for the same missing thing.

None of these is hard; they are recorded because nothing else records them and
because each was a surprise. **A fourth was found with them and is fixed**:
calling an operator function by its name - `a.operator+(b)`, `operator+(a, b)`
- was refused with `'operator' is not supported yet` about a feature this
compiler has. See "Operator overloading".

**A fifth was found here and is fixed**: `const S s = {};`, an empty braced
initialiser, was refused with "an initialiser list needs at least one value" - a
rule about lists answering a question about `{}` meaning `T()`. It was the first
thing a reader tried after the const refusal above, so the two together were a
wall. See "An empty pair of braces is value-initialisation".

## What is in `tools/`, and what was inherited and is dead

Audited 2026-08-30, because a fork carries its parent's scaffolding and nobody
notices until somebody runs one and it fails at a path that has not existed
since the fork.

| tool | state |
| --- | --- |
| `verify-three` | the three-box rule with a command behind it |
| `mangled-names` | cxx1's names beside clang's, all three targets |
| `cl-measure` | asks cl on the Windows box about the Microsoft ABI |
| `unwind-check` | rung 6's tables |
| `windows/` | the Windows half of `verify-three`, kept in the repo on purpose |
| `windows/asm-run.cmd` | one `.asm` assembled, linked and run on the box - seconds, not a rebuild |
| `backend-overlap` | python3; how much of the two code generators is the same algorithm twice. Still works, mentioned nowhere until now |
| `gen-corpus` | python3; generates a corpus of a given size. Still works; its comments cite a `tests/challenge.sh` that did not come across |

**Three were removed rather than left to rot**: `against-gcc`, `ccc` and
`cc1-as-clang`, all inherited from Compiler-C and all driving `$ROOT/cc1` - a
binary this repository has never had, since the one here is `cxx1.exe`. `ccc`
also pointed at a `docs/STATUS.md` that did not come across either. None of
them could run; keeping them meant the next reader had to work that out again.

**`tests/c-corpus/` is not obsolete and is not a pass rate.** Compiler-C's 425
cases, inherited and untriaged - much of it is valid C++11 and much is not.
Its status is above, under the fork; leave it until somebody triages it case by
case.

**`./build` was live, correct and orphaned, and `verify-three` goes through it
now.** It caps a build at 300 MB through `systemd-run` and says so plainly when
no cgroup is available, and it was written after an unbounded `dnf` drove the
419 MiB Linux box into swap until sshd could not fork. Nothing referenced it,
and `verify-three` - the only thing that ever builds on that box - ran a bare
`make -j4`: a safety net nobody was under. That is exactly what thrashed on
2026-08-30, when a killed run left its `make` orphaned on the far side, a
second run overlapped it, and eight `cc1plus` competed for 419 MB with zram at
100%. Under the cap the runaway is killed alone and the box stays up.

**-j2 and not -j4.** One `cc1plus` on the big parser files peaks near 50 MB, so
two fit inside 300 MB with room and four sit at the cap's edge - where a
legitimate build would be killed and reported as a verification failure. Raise
it deliberately, having measured, or not at all.

`obj/` and `tests/out-*/` are build output, gitignored, and regenerate on
demand - 36 MB of the tree between them. `.DS_Store` files are ignored too and
were swept.

## The names are asked of cl now, on the box where cl lives

`tools/windows/names-vs-cl.cmd`, run by `verify-three` and reported as
**windows names vs cl**. For every case it builds an object with cxx1 and one
with cl, dumps both symbol tables, and the Mac diffs them.

**Why, when `names.sh` already checks the names.** That one asks clang with
`-target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, which is a second implementation of the
Microsoft ABI. This page has said for a while that a Microsoft question goes to
cl first and clang second - and yet every mangled name this compiler emits was
checked only against the second, on a Mac, by a compiler nobody links with.

**It found a real defect on its first run, and one no name comparison could
have found.** Every `static` function came out of the object as an **External**
symbol: two translation units each with their own `static int total(...)` would
have collided at the link. The *names* were right and agreed with clang - what
was wrong was the storage class beside them, which only a symbol table shows.

The cause is a MASM default. cxx1's `PUBLIC` list was correct all along and
left a `static` function out of it, exactly as the Itanium side leaves the `L`
out of the name - but **MASM exports every `PROC` unless told otherwise**, so
the directive exported it anyway. `OPTION PROC:PRIVATE` in the preamble, and
70 of 78 cases now agree with cl where 37 did.

**`tools/mangled-names` had to be taught to ignore directives** in the same
change: its PROC rule reads `<name> PROC` as a definition, and
`OPTION PROC:PRIVATE` has that shape - so the line that fixed the bug was
scraped as a symbol called `OPTION` and reported as a difference in all 78
cases at once. A sweeping failure in a tool that has been stable for weeks is
worth suspecting *the tool* over the change.

**A `.nocl` file records a difference against cl**, as `.nonames` records one
against clang, and the reason is printed rather than swallowed. The eight are
worth knowing apart:

* `constexpr-function` - **a language-version difference, not an ABI one.** cl
  has no C++11 mode, its floor being `/std:c++14`, and C++11's rule that a
  `constexpr` member function is implicitly const was removed in C++14. So
  cxx1 writes `?twice@Board@@QEBAHH@Z` and cl writes `QEAA`, and both are right
  for the language they are reading. clang at `-std=c++11` agrees with cxx1.
* `local-class`, `local-class-main` - cl inlines the local classes' members
  away and emits nothing; cxx1 has no COMDAT and emits a real function. The
  same difference `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` records as "an inline member function
  is a strong symbol".
* `array-of-class` - cl calls its own vector constructor iterator `??_H`; cxx1
  emits the loop inline. Nothing outside the object can tell.
* `destructor`, `implicit-move`, `cleanup`, `try-catch-value` - a deleting
  destructor cl writes, and this target's exception funclets.

## Rung 7.6: lambdas, and the ladder is walked

**A closure is a class with a call operator, generated where the lambda is
written**, so this needed both of the pieces that came before it - a class that
can be defined inside a function, and `operator()`. Three decisions carry the
rest.

**The object lives in the enclosing frame.** A lambda expression *is* a class
temporary, and this compiler has none - the same gap that refuses
`return P(1);`. So the closure gets a frame slot of its own and the expression
answers with a `Var` naming it. Its lifetime is the function rather than the
full expression, which is longer than [expr.prim.lambda] asks for and harmless
while a closure has nothing to destroy. It is also what makes an immediately
invoked lambda work without any temporary machinery at all.

**The body is replayed as a member function**, through the same held-body path
a class written inside a function already used - so nothing in the definition
machinery had to learn what a lambda is. That path wants tokens shaped like a
definition, which a lambda's are not, so they are synthesised:
`<ret> operator ( ) ( <params> ) const { <body> }`, built from the lambda's own
parameter and body tokens and appended to the stream. An *index* into `tokens_`
survives the vector growing, which is what makes appending safe where a pointer
would not be.

**The return type is spelled as a hidden typedef.** Synthesising tokens for an
arbitrary type is not possible in general - `int` is one token, `const char *`
is three, a class is its tag - so the deduced type is registered under a
made-up name and that one identifier is written instead. Those names never
reset where the closure numbering does, or two functions each numbering from
zero ask for `$lret1` twice.

### Deduction reads the body, and follows clang rather than the letter

[expr.prim.lambda]/4 as C++11 wrote it says a body of the form
`{ return e; }` has e's type and **anything else is void** - so
`[](){ auto i = ...; return i(); }` would deduce void and then be ill-formed.
clang accepts it under `-std=c++11` anyway, applying the relaxation C++14 made,
and real C++11 code is written expecting that. **The oracle is followed here
rather than the letter, and this is the one place in this compiler where that
happens** - said out loud because it is a choice.

So the first `return` **at the body's own brace depth** is what deduces, and
depth is not a detail: in `{ auto i = [](){ return 1; }; return i(); }` the
first `return` token belongs to the inner lambda. The statements before it are
parsed too, in a throwaway scope with the parameters declared and the enclosing
function's locals put aside - the expression may name a local the body
declared, and jumping straight to the return leaves it undeclared.

**One closure per lambda written, however often it is read.** 7.1 reads an
`auto` initialiser twice, so `auto f = [](int a){...};` reached the lambda
parser twice and made two classes - and the declaration then refused its own
initialiser, `'f' is 'struct main::$_0' and this is 'struct main::$_1'`. Keyed
by the token the `[` sits at, which is the same on every reading.

### What it found in the machinery underneath

**`returnType_` belonged to the function being read, and the replay reads a
different one.** Local classes hid this: a member's body set it to whatever
that member returned, and the enclosing function's next `return` happened to
want the same type. A lambda made it visible - a `void` one, and the function
that wrote it was then told its own `return` was wrong.
`replayInlineBodies` restores it, with `functionName_` and `atFunctionBody_`.

**The closure numbering does not match clang's and does not have to.**
[expr.prim.lambda] makes a closure a unique unnamed type. Both compilers write
`$_N` within the enclosing function; cxx1 numbers in the order they are
written and clang does not - measured on a file whose *third* lambda came out
`$_0`. Nothing links against these: the call operator is reached through the
object and the object never leaves the function that made it.
`tests/cases/lambda.nonames` records it for all three targets.

### Captures, and rung 7.6 finished

**A capture is a member of the closure**, copied from the enclosing function
where the lambda is written - and reading one inside the body needed no new
rule at all: `operator()` is a member function, and an unqualified name in one
already means `this->name`. The class is laid out as any class is, each member
at the next offset its alignment allows.

**The copying happens on every reading of the lambda, not only the first**, and
that is the bug this cost. 7.1 reads an `auto` initialiser twice and the second
reading takes the cached class - so with the copying beside the building, the
object the declaration actually kept was never initialised at all. It printed
`-15 -341155503` where it should have printed `6 7`. `buildClosure` is called
from both the building path and the cache hit, and the capture list is kept
beside the type for exactly that.

The captures are declared in the deduction scope too. That reading hides the
enclosing locals - a lambda body sees its own parameters and, without a
capture, nothing of the function around it - so a captured name has to be put
back, or `[k](int a){ return a + k; }` cannot deduce its own return type.

### `[=]` takes everything the body reads, and finding it is a scan

An earlier refusal said a default capture "would need a second pass over the
body this parser does not make". It makes one now, and the shape of it matters:
**a scan of the body's tokens, not a parse.** An identifier that names a local
of the enclosing function is captured, unless the token before it says it is a
member name - `p.k`, `p->k` and `N::k` name no local.

**Over-capturing is harmless and under-capturing is not**, which settles every
doubtful case in that scan. A name the body declares itself shadows the member,
because a local is looked up before a member, and a parameter does the same -
so a copy nobody reads is the worst it can do. `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` records
that a closure can therefore be larger than the standard's minimum.

**A capture goes in a scope of its own**, outside the parameters and the body.
All three in one scope made `[=](int a)` where the enclosing function also has
an `a` report that `a` was declared twice, and did the same for a body that
declares a name it captured. Both are things C++ allows and both now shadow.

**A reference captured by value copies what it refers to**, and needed nothing:
every mention of a reference here is already lowered to a dereference, so
`objectRef` hands back the object.

**`[&]`, `[&x]` and a mixed list work too**, and they waited on reference data
members rather than on anything about lambdas - see below. Once those existed
this was mostly the same code as capturing by value, with `bindReference` in
place of the assignment and the same pointer-sized slot.

### `[this]`, and the three lookups that had to learn it

The closure holds a pointer to the enclosing object and the body reaches
through it. What made this more than a fourth capture is that **inside the call
operator `currentClass_` is the closure**, so every way of naming something in
the enclosing class looked in the wrong place - and each is a different piece
of the parser:

* the word **`this`** meant the closure's own, which is never what the reader
  wrote. [expr.prim.lambda] says it is the captured one.
* an unqualified **data member** was searched for in the closure and not found.
* an unqualified **member call** was searched for the same way, in the branch
  that runs *before* the free-function one - so `twice()` reported that no such
  function was declared, saying nothing about members at all. Putting the new
  check after that branch changed nothing, which is the tell: the free-call
  branch had already failed.

**A lambda has the access of the function it was written in**,
[expr.prim.lambda]/7, so a private member is reachable from one. Both access
checks ask `insideAccessOf` for that now rather than comparing `currentClass_`
themselves - **they had already drifted apart once in the writing of this**: the
data-member check learned about closures and the member-function one did not,
so a private field was readable from a lambda and a private method was not.
Two checks of the same rule will always drift; one helper is the fix.

**`this` is kept in the deduction scope**, unlike every other local. That
reading hides the enclosing function's locals - a lambda body sees its own
parameters and, without a capture, nothing else - but a body naming a member
reaches it through `this`, and hiding that left `[this](){ return n; }`
reporting that `n` is a member with no object to read it from, which is what
the machinery says when `this` has gone missing.

**The Windows box caught a bad case, not a bad compiler.**
`lambda-capture-this` first put a call that *mutates* the object among the
`printf` arguments that read it - and the order arguments are evaluated in is
unspecified. The two Itanium targets go one way and x86_64-windows the other,
so it printed `5 5 15 16 6 10` on two boxes and `6 6 18 19 6 10` on the third.
Both are right; the case was wrong, and only the third box could say so. A
mutation among arguments belongs in a statement of its own.

**`mutable` is the whole of the difference between a const call operator and a
non-const one**, and that is all it turned out to be: [expr.prim.lambda] makes
a closure's `operator()` const unless the lambda says otherwise, so a by-value
capture cannot be written through without it. One flag on the declaration and
one token in the synthesised body - and what is written is the closure's *own*
copy, the enclosing variable being untouched, which is what capturing by value
means. `[&]` is how you write through to the original and already did.

The keyword is still refused on a *data member*, which is a different feature
and stays on the list of words this parser knows and has no rule for.

### A lambda inside a lambda, taking the capture of the one around it

**The name is not a local by then**, which is the whole difficulty. The outer
lambda's capture is a member of the outer *closure*, so `findLocal` answers
nothing. `outerCaptureAccess` reaches through the outer `this`, and it is asked
in three places that have to agree: where a named capture is looked up, where
the `[=]`/`[&]` scan decides what to take, and where the closure object is built
and the copy is actually made. Miss the third and the class is right and the
object is uninitialised - the same shape as the bug captures had when they
first landed.

**The tag needed a counter, and the reason is not obvious.** A closure is named
after the function that writes it - but inside a replay that function is
`operator()`, so every level of nesting built `operator()::$_0` and the third
was told its own call operator was declared twice. The *owners* differ, each
closure's operator() having its own linkage name, so the owner decides and a
counter separates the display tags. It is the disambiguation local classes
already had, which is why it was three lines: **a general rule written once for
one feature paid for a second.**

With that, every capture C++11 has is here: by value, by reference, `[=]`,
`[&]`, `[this]`, `mutable`, and nesting to any depth. **That sentence was one
short for three weeks** - a capture-default also takes `this`, which this scan
did not do until 2026-09-09; see "A capture-default takes `this` as well". - by then that name is a member of the outer
closure and not a local, so the scan has nothing to take.

## Reference data members, refused since rung 3

**What one occupies is a pointer, and asking the type is the wrong question.**
`sizeof` a reference is the size of what it refers to, which is right for
`sizeof` and wrong for a slot - so the layout asks a *slot type* while the
declared type stays the reference, which is what tells every read of it to
dereference. That one sentence is the whole reason this was refused for so
long, and why a pointer member was not a substitute: it would have compiled and
lied about its own type.

**It is bound, never assigned**, and the mem-initialiser list is the one place
that can happen. `bindReference` supplies the address - the same road a
reference local's initialiser takes - and the member is typed as the pointer it
really is for the store.

**A const object does not reach through it.** [dcl.ref]: the const stops at the
reference, which could not be rebound anyway, so `h.r` on a const `h` is still
`int &`. Applying the object's cv-qualification here - which is right for every
other member - made a `const` member function unable to return its own
reference member, and that is how the rule was found.

**Three read paths had to learn it, not one**: `.`, `->`, and the implicit
`this->name` an unqualified name inside a member function takes. The first two
were changed together and the third was missed, which the case caught at once -
`return r;` inside a member function goes through none of the paths a reader
thinks of first.

This is what `[&]` was waiting for, and it is what the refusal said. Naming the
real blocker rather than calling the feature unwritten is what made the order
obvious when it came time to do it.

## Class temporaries: one gap, three symptoms

`P(1)` builds a temporary now. It was reachable three ways and refused in all
of them - as an expression, as `return P(1);`, and as `static_cast<T &&>` of a
prvalue - which is what made it the most valuable thing left rather than the
most visible. Lambda captures were a fourth: a capture has to be initialised
where the lambda is written.

**The object goes in a slot of this frame and the expression answers with its
name**, the constructor sequenced in front by a comma. That is the shape
`materialiseCopy` already built for a by-value class parameter; what was
missing was a way to ask for one by writing the type.

**The shape is `*(P::P(&tmp, 1), &tmp)` and not `(P::P(&tmp, 1), tmp)`.** The
second reads better and cannot work: `isGlvalue` gives a comma its right
operand's value category, so the parser would let anyone take its address - and
**taking the address of a comma is not something the three backends know**.
`take(P(4))` found that immediately, since passing by value takes an address.
Writing it as a dereference says the same thing with a shape all three already
handle, because the address of `*p` is `p`.

The temporary is destroyed at the end of the full expression, [class.temporary]
/4, which is what `pendingTemps_` was already for.

**What it did not fix**: `T(3);` as a statement on its own - a temporary built
and discarded. The statement parser reads a type name followed by `(` as a
declaration and reports `expected ')'`. It is the vexing-parse machinery that
would have to be told, `tests/cases/constructor-vexing` pins the behaviour that
makes it delicate, and a discarded temporary is worth less than that risk.

## Member initialisers, `int x = 5;` on the member itself

**Kept as a place in the token stream**, the way a default argument is and for
the same reason: [class.base.init] evaluates one per *construction*, in a
constructor that may not have been read when the class was, so one parsed tree
could not serve them all. Read again at each constructor that needs it, with
the enclosing locals put aside - a member's initialiser may name a global or an
enumerator and cannot name a local of whatever function happens to be
compiling.

**[class.base.init]/9 makes it a fallback and not an override**, member by
member rather than all or nothing. `S(int a) : x(a) { }` on a class with
`int x = 1; int y = 2;` takes x from the list and y from the class, which is
what `member-initialiser` pins.

**A class with nothing but an initialiser still needs a constructor**, and this
is where it could have gone silently wrong. The implicit default constructor is
only declared when it has *work* to do - a vptr, a base with one, a member with
one - and an initialiser on a member is now another thing that counts. Without
that line there is no function to put the store in, and `S s;` leaves x holding
whatever was on the stack: a silent wrong answer of exactly the kind the array
bug was.

**And the array path had to say it was using the constructor.** Every other
route to one goes through `resolveOverload`, which marks it used;
`constructLocalArray` looks the default up directly and did not. It went
unnoticed while the only classes with implicit constructors were ones that also
had members or bases with constructors - a class whose *only* reason to have one
is a member initialiser is what exposed it, and `S a[2];` called `S::S()` with
nothing defining it. A declared-and-never-emitted function is a link error, so
this one at least announces itself.

## Pointers to data members, and why no backend heard about them

**`int S::*` is not a pointer to anything.** What it holds is an *offset* into
an object of the class, so `s.*p` is `*(T *)((char *)&s + p)` - an add and two
casts all three code generators already knew. A new `Kind` in the type system
and not a line in any backend, which is the same trade a reference took when it
was lowered to a slot holding an address.

**The cast to `char *` is the one thing that can be got wrong quietly.**
Without it the add is scaled by the member's size and the answer is wrong
rather than refused, which is why it is written down here and in the case.

**`&S::x` is read where `&` is**, because nothing else would: the qualified-name
path in `primary` answers for a *static* member, which is an ordinary object
with an ordinary address, and a non-static member has no address of its own to
take at all. The offset is a `Num` with the member-pointer type on it.

**The declarator restarts.** `int S::*p` reaches the `::` loop that qualifies a
name being defined, and what follows is a star rather than a name - so the
member-pointer type is built there and `declarator` is called again from the
star. `int S::**pp` and `int S::*a[3]` then come out right with no rule of their
own.

**Size is the one thing that is not the same everywhere**: Itanium keeps a
`ptrdiff_t` and Microsoft an `int` for a class with single inheritance, so 8 and
4. Measured with clang for both, and `Type::size` already took a target.

**Both manglings measured**: Itanium writes `M` then the class then the member's
type - `int S::*` is `M1Si` - with the class going in *as a type*, so it takes
part in the substitution table like any other. Microsoft writes `PEQ` then the
class's scope then the type, `PEQS@@H`, where an ordinary `int *` is `PEAH`.

### And pointers to member functions, which are a different animal

Not an offset but a code address and how to find the `this`. Measured: Itanium
keeps a **pair**, 16 bytes; Microsoft keeps a single code pointer, 8. The two
ABIs disagree about the shape and not merely the spelling.

**It wears the shape of a struct, and that is the whole trick.** Giving it a
kind of its own would have meant teaching three backends to copy, pass and
return one, at each of the dozen places they ask `isStructOrUnion()` - the
by-value machinery rungs 3 and 4 depend on. Giving it the *shape* of a struct
meant teaching them nothing: `kind_` is Struct with the ABI's own members, and
a flag is what tells `describe()` and the manglers what it really is.

**The object and the code pointer have to reach the call together**, and no
expression here holds a pair. So `o.*p` answers with the code pointer and
leaves the address in the parser for the `(` in `postfix` to pick up as the
first argument. The window is one token wide, which is what makes it safe:
`(o.*p)` is only ever written in order to be called.

**The parenthesised-declarator branch had to learn the shape.** `int (*p)()`
and `int (S::*p)()` are the same thing to it - what is inside the parentheses
points at something, so what follows them is a parameter list and not an array
bound. Without that, `int (S::*f)()` built `int` and handed the inner
declarator the wrong base. Once it was told, the member-pointer code needed no
look-ahead at all: **the base says which of the two kinds this is.**

Both manglings measured: Itanium writes `M` then the class then the function
type - `M1SFivE`, the same `M` a data member pointer uses - and Microsoft `P8`
then the class then an ordinary member signature, `P8S@@EAAHXZ`, where a data
member pointer writes `PEQ`.

**A case must not print `sizeof` of one of these.** It is 16 on the Itanium
targets and 8 on x86_64-windows, both right, so a case that prints it passes on
two boxes out of three - and `member-function-pointer` did, until the Windows
box said so. That is the second time in one session a target-dependent value
was baked into an expected output, the first being an evaluation order; both
were caught by the third machine and by nothing else.

**Refused by name: a pointer to a *virtual* member function**, which keeps a
vtable index in the low bit on Itanium and branches on it at every call, and
calls a compiler-emitted thunk on Microsoft. And **a pointer to a *const*
member function**: the constness of `this` is decided where the member is
declared and is not part of a function type here, so taking the word would make
a pointer that could be given a non-const member's address and then called on a
const object.

## Decisions already taken

**Conform to the platform ABI; do not invent one.** Itanium C++ ABI on Linux
and macOS, Microsoft ABI on Windows. It costs more up front and it is what
makes clang and cl usable as oracles at the object level — mangled names and
vtable layouts can be diffed directly. An invented ABI links with nothing and
can be checked against nothing.

**Instantiate a template by replaying its tokens, and give up two-phase
lookup for it.** The reasoning is in the rung-5 section; what it buys is that
no second AST and no second lookup pass has to exist, and what it costs is that
cxx1 will accept a program clang refuses. Recorded here because it reverses
what this file used to say.

**Build the constant evaluator early.** Array bounds, enumerator values,
`static_assert` and every non-type template argument need it, and `constexpr`
is that evaluator exposed to the user. It is not a rung-7 feature.

**A keyword that is recognised but not implemented must be refused by name.**
`"'typeid' is not supported yet"`, not a parse error twenty tokens later.
Diagnostics ship with the rule that intercepts them.

## Understandable means checkable - the principle the 09-02 review applied

**A change makes this compiler more understandable when it makes more of it
*checkable*, and less when it buys tidiness with a fact nobody can re-measure.**
That is the one sentence every proposal in `docs/DESIGN-REVIEW-2026-09-02.md`
was judged against, and it is the reason that review reads as it does. What is
being maximised is not how the code looks at a glance. It is how much of what
the code claims a reader can go and confirm - against clang, against cl, against
a suite that fails when the claim is wrong.

Six rules fall out of it, each with the case in this tree that produced it.

**1. A measured fact stays re-measurable, and stays beside its measurement.**
`Abi` is eleven unlabelled positionals: the densest table of measured ABI facts
in the tree, unreadable at exactly the place someone would go to check it. The
mend names the fields without moving them. The same rule is what refuses an IR
and a register allocator: they would make register choice a global property, and
every `movq 56(%rsp), %rcx` recorded in this file would stop being a line anyone
can put to clang.

**2. Duplication is judged by which agreement it hides.** Two copies inside one
target - the caller and the callee each classifying arguments by hand - must
become one, because the agreement between them is what A-01 broke, consistently
on both sides, where no suite could see it. Two copies across targets stay two,
because divergence between targets is this project's house bug class and a
shared abstraction is exactly what would hide it. The LSDA is the one exception
and proves the rule: same table and same encoding bytes on both Itanium targets,
the difference only in spelling - so the difference goes into a small struct
where it is *visible*, rather than into a second hand-written copy where it is
one missed edit away from silent divergence.

**3. An invariant a person has to remember is a defect with a delay on it.**
Seventeen accessors forward class state through `unqual_` by hand and three do
not; `frameSize - slot` is computed at four sites; "mark this function used" is
spelled three ways. Every one of those was already a bug once here. The mend is
to make the rule structural - one `ClassInfo` the qualified copy points at, one
`establisherOffset`, one `markUsed` - and not to write the reminder more loudly.
A rule that can be forgotten will be.

**4. Refuse by name, and never accept quietly.** This is the standing rule
applied to design: a target that cannot do something says so where the reason is
known, which is what `.notarget` and the parser's refusals are for, and what a
`Backend::supports(feature)` table would take away by moving the refusal off the
line that knows why. The corollary the review found is sharper: a refusal that is
*unreachable*, or one that names a feature the compiler now has - `pending[]`
still calls `template` and `virtual` unsupported - is worse than none, because it
is a claim the compiler makes at the user and cannot support.

**5. A claim with no oracle is not allowed to be believed.** `tests/emit.sh`
compiles every case for three targets and counts what compiled; it never
compares the assembly. So "this refactor changes no behaviour" had nothing in
the suite to prove it with, and the whole plan reorders around building that
first. The same instinct is already written down two sections up as *a green
suite proves nothing until you prove what it ran against*; this is that rule
turned on the refactor rather than on the compiler.

**6. What must not change is half the finding.** Each of the four reports ends
with shapes that look wrong and are load-bearing: absolute token indices, the
by-value `Signature`, a member-function pointer wearing the shape of a struct,
`unqualifiedSpecifiers` answering void for `Point::Point(`. A review that
produces only a list of changes has not finished, because the next reader will
tidy one of those away and find out why it was there from a failing suite - or
worse, from a silent wrong answer.

**Where this came from, honestly.** Four of the six were in the brief the
reviewers were given: measure rather than read, refuse at the point of
interception, the suites are the oracle, and name what should not change. Two
were not. **The emit.sh gap was found unprompted and inverted the order of
everything else**, and *make the invariant structural rather than remembered*
was reached independently by three of the four, in three subsystems that share
no code - which is the kind of agreement worth promoting from an observation to
a rule.

**The test to put a future proposal through**, in this order: does it leave every
measured fact as easy to re-measure? Does it hide an agreement that is currently
checked, or reveal one that currently is not? And can its own claim of "nothing
changed" be *shown* - if not, build the thing that would show it first.

## What the compiler says about itself, and where it said it wrongly

**Four claims cxx1 made about itself were untrue, and three of them travelled in
its output.** The MASM preamble said `Generated by cc1`, the DWARF producer said
`cc1`, and `DW_AT_language` said **DW_LANG_C89** - inherited whole from the C
compiler this was forked from. The fourth was `make help` and the usage line,
which offered `<file.c>` and a `-g` that stops on "a line of C".

**The language byte is the one that does something.** With C89 a debugger treats
a symbol as a C name; with `DW_LANG_C_plus_plus` it treats it as C++. Measured on
the Mac after the change: lldb prints the frame as ``dw`::add(int, int)`` where it
had printed a bare `add`, stops at `dw.cpp:1:24` with `a=1, b=2` readable, and a
breakpoint set by *name* now matches every base name in the process the way it
does for a clang-built C++ program. That last one looks like a regression and is
the language being told the truth.

**The preamble change is what the golden was built for.** 135 files changed, all
of them `x86_64-windows`, each by exactly one replaced line - checked, not
assumed, which before the golden existed was not something anybody could say.

## Access control asked from the wrong class, in both directions

**Seven access checks were written `currentClass_ != cls`**, each before
`insideAccessOf` existed, and two of them refused ordinary code:

```cpp
class Base { protected: static const int shared; Base(); };
struct Derived : Base { int get() { return shared; } };   // refused
```

[class.access.base]/5 lets a derived class name a *protected* member of its
base, and `insideAccessOf` knew it - its `derivesFrom` clause is exactly that
rule - while seven sites asked the question themselves. Routing them through
the helper fixed the static member and not the constructor, and the reason is
worth keeping: **the implicit special members are synthesised while a class is
being *completed***, so `currentClass_` is not reliably the class they belong
to. `accessibleFrom(from, owner, access)` is the second helper, asking from a
class named outright rather than from the one being parsed. A base with a
protected default constructor - the shape that says *derive from me, do not
build me directly* - could not be derived from at all until it existed.

**And the same rule missing in the other direction let ill-formed code
through.** A base's private member was readable from a derived class by all
three spellings, and the cause was in the layout rather than in the check: a
base's data members are copied down into the derived class's list - that
flattening *is* the layout - carrying their access but no record of **whose**
they were, so the check asked whether it was inside the class the member was
reached *through*, which it was. `Member::declaredIn` is that record.

**Two things went wrong writing it, and both are the house shape.** I added a
fallback permitting access from the class it was reached through, which
re-permits precisely what [class.access.base]/1 forbids - `this->x` passed
while `x` still failed, which is how it was caught. And the third spelling, an
unqualified `x` inside a member function, called no access check at all: three
ways to name a member and the rule written into two of them. The diagnostic
also named the class it was reached through, sending a reader to a class whose
source never mentions the member; it names the declaring one now.

**`new S(1)` reached a private constructor** that `S s(1);` on the line above
is refused for - the eighth site, and the one no sweep of `currentClass_ !=`
would have found, because it had no check to write wrongly.

`tests/cases/access-through-base.cpp` is the understepping half, two levels
deep; `private-base-member-refused.cpp` and `new-private-constructor-refused.cpp`
are the overstepping half.

## Eight nested-parse doors, and one list between them

**cxx1 re-enters parsing from a saved token index in eight places**, and each
door wrote its own list of per-function state to save and put back. Each list
was written separately, which is exactly how `alive_` came to be missing from
one of them - a lambda in a function holding any destructible object emitted
the *enclosing* function's destructors against its own frame. A review found
**six more fields still missing from that same list**, and a worse door beside
it.

`captureFunctionState` / `restoreFunctionState` / `clearFunctionState` are the
one list now. A per-function field added to the parser is added there and
nowhere else. What is deliberately outside it: the monotonic counters
(`refTemps_`, `strings_`, `caseIds_`, `lambdaRetSeq_`), whose whole job is to
stay unique across a restore, and `inUnnamedNamespace_`, which is linkage for
the file rather than state for a function.

| door | had been saving | what leaked |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `replayInlineBodies` | 31 fields | `loopDepth_`/`breakMarks_`, `switchDepth_`/`switches_`, `inTryBody_`, `inMsHandler_`, `mayThrow_`, `conditionDecl_` |
| `deduceLambdaReturn` | 3 fields | `alive_`, `labels_`/`gotos_`, `functionHasTry_`, `functionHasPads_`, `functionTypeIndex_`, `frameSize_` |
| `deduceAuto`, `sizeof`, `decltype`, `noexcept` | `at_` only | `pendingTemps_` - a discarded parse registered a temporary that was later destroyed though nothing built it |
| `instantiateClass` | class stack, bindings | `angleSplit_` |
| `applyDefaults` | locals, function name | `namespaceStack_`, `currentClass_` |

**`deduceLambdaReturn` is not `clearFunctionState`'s kind, and treating it as
one broke nested lambdas twice.** A replayed body is a different function and
starts with nothing; this parse happens *inside* the enclosing function - its
closures are numbered in that function's sequence and named after it, and a
nested `[=]` reaches its captures. Clearing everything reset `lambdaCount_` so
the inner closure was `$_0` again and collided, and lost the outer captures so
`[=]` could not find them. Only what the body *accumulates* is emptied now, and
the identity stays. **The guard was right and the clear was wrong**, which is
worth remembering the next time a ninth door is added.

**The emit golden reports 27 of 627 files changed** - the first root to change
any existing emission, and the change is frame offsets shrinking by eight in
the lambda and default-argument cases. `frameSize_` is restored now, so slots
allocated during a throwaway deduction parse no longer inflate the enclosing
function's frame. Smaller frames, identical behaviour, 357 cases green.

**One finding is not claimed as fixed.** A default argument in `namespace N`
naming N's own `k` still reads the caller's `::k`. The scope restoration above
is correct and the class half works - a default naming its own class's
enumerator resolves - but `findGlobal` tries the flat table *before*
`qualifyForLookup`, so once a global `k` exists the qualified name never gets a
chance. That is the item `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` already records as deferred, and
it is R1's neighbour rather than this root's remainder.

`tests/cases/nested-parse-state.cpp` reaches all eight fields in one program,
with a ledger line for the `alive_` half.

## A capture by value of a class or an array, and the name it exposed

**[expr.prim.lambda]/21: a by-copy capture is a member of the closure**,
initialised from the entity it names - which for a class means its copy
constructor and for an array means copying the array. cxx1 did neither.

**A class was copied bytewise and never destroyed**, and the two cancelled in
the output: one construction, one destruction, the right number printed. Only
the object ledger could see it, which is the case for having built the ledger
first. The cause was not the capture code: **the closure type was completed
and never given the special members every other class gets**, so it had no
implicit copy constructor to call and no implicit destructor to run.
`declareImplicitSpecials` on it is the whole fix, and fixing it at the capture
site instead would have produced a copy that was still never destroyed - a
leak in place of a bytewise copy.

**An array was worse and needed no ledger.** `decay` handed the member a
*pointer* to the original where the member *is* the array, so `[arr]` and
`[=]` both returned whatever the frame held from three lines of ordinary C++.
An `Assign` cannot mend it either - an array is not assignable, which is why
the copy constructor copies an array member with a loop. It is an element-wise
copy now, **flattened to the innermost element**, because the decayed pointer
to `int[2][3]` steps by *rows* and casting it to the element type is what makes
the arithmetic step by elements; built through `arithmetic()` and never a bare
`Binary`, pointer scaling living there.

### And that exposed a naming bug older than lambdas

**Emitting a closure's implicit specials showed they had no local-name
wrapper**, and neither did any local class's:

```cpp
static int one() { struct L { int v; L() : v(1) {} ~L() {} }; L a; return a.v; }
static int two() { struct L { int v; L() : v(2) {} ~L() {} }; L b; return b.v; }
```

clang prints `1 2`; cxx1 said **`error: symbol '__ZN1LC1Ev' is already
defined`**. [class.local] makes those two `L`s two types and both ABIs wrap the
enclosing function's name round a member's for exactly that reason - but the
wrap was applied to a *named* member and to nothing else, so a constructor and
a destructor were spelled as though the class were at file scope. Valid C++11
that would not compile at all, needing two local classes of one name with
constructors in one translation unit to reach - until lambdas made local
classes ubiquitous.

**Fixed at the funnel rather than at the seven call sites** that compute a
constructor or destructor name, that being the N-1-of-N trap this whole audit
is made of. The `Type` already carries `localOwner()`: `itaniumWrapLocal` wraps
the finished Itanium name the way `itaniumLocalMemberName` already wrapped a
member's, and Microsoft's `scopeOf` already took a `localOwner` that only the
member path was passing.

`tests/cases/lambda-capture-by-value.cpp` pins the captures - every mutation
in it happens *after* the lambdas are made, so a copy that still sees one is a
pointer wearing a copy's type - and `local-class-two-functions.cpp` pins the
names, `1 2 3 40`.

## A written destructor destroyed nothing the class held

**[class.dtor]/8: after the body has run, a destructor destroys the class's
non-static data members in reverse declaration order, then its bases in
reverse.** That walk existed in exactly one place - the destructor the
*compiler* writes - and the destructor the *program* writes had only the base
half:

```cpp
struct B { ~B() { printf("~B "); } };
struct M { ~M() { printf("~M "); } };
struct D : B { M m; ~D() { printf("~D "); } };   // clang ~D ~M ~B, cxx1 ~D ~B
```

So any class with `~C() { }` and a `std::string` member leaked the string, and
no base and no inheritance were needed - `struct D { P x; ~D() { } };` is
enough. It is the constructor bug of "A base's members were built twice" in
its mirror: one walk that two paths need, written into one of them.

**Mended by sharing the walk rather than copying it.** `memberDestructors` is
the member half lifted out of `synthesizeDestructor`, and both callers use it -
the written path inserting it after the body and before the bases, which is
[class.dtor]/8's own order. Bases were already there and are untouched.

**The emit golden reports 0 of 627 files changed**, and that is the finding
rather than a reassurance: not one case in the suite has a class with a
written destructor *and* a member that needs destroying. That is exactly why
354 green cases never saw it, and why `tests/cases/lifetime-ledger.cpp` now
carries the shape - a written destructor with both a member and a base, which
reported `live=1` against clang's `live=0` while printing identical output.

**Found by a Fable 5.1 review** (`docs/audit-2026-09-06.html` V-01, root R2),
and it is the defect that made the case for fixing the oracle first: the
program prints the same characters either way.

**One neighbour is not this and stays open.** `G a = make(4); G b(a);` for a
class returned by value still reports `live=1 phantom=1`, identically before
and after this fix, so it is a root of its own rather than a remainder of this
one.

## Three scopes, and they were being asked in nearly the reverse order

**[basic.lookup.unqual]/1 and [basic.scope.hiding]/1: the nearest declaration
wins.** An unqualified name in a member function has three scopes to search
and one order to search them in - the block, then the class, then the
namespace. This parser asked namespace-scope enumerators *first*, then locals
and globals together, and members *last* and only where no global of that name
existed. Both consequences were silent wrong values in ordinary code:

```cpp
enum { A = 1, K = 2 };
int f(int K) { return K; }
int main() { int A = 5; printf("%d %d\n", A, f(7)); }   // clang 5 7, cxx1 1 2
```

```cpp
int k = 10;
struct S { int k; S() : k(3) {} int get() { return k; } };  // clang 3, cxx1 10
```

An enumerator hid a local *and* a parameter; a global hid a data member, which
also made a `[k]` capture and a `[this]` capture read the global. Any class
whose member shares a name with any global anywhere in the program read the
wrong object, and nothing was said.

**The middle rung is what makes this more than swapping the ends.** A class's
own enumerator is at *class* scope: it beats a global and loses to a local.
`findEnum` searched the flat namespace table before walking the class stack, so
it could never outrank a global; `findClassEnum` is that walk on its own, asked
at step two. And `objectRef` did locals-then-globals as a single step, which
cannot express a scope that belongs *between* them - it is `localRef` and
`globalRef` now, with `objectRef` kept as the pair for the callers that are not
inside a class and have no middle step to take.

**The emit golden reports 0 of 627 files changed.** A reordering of name lookup
altered nothing that already compiled, which says both that the change is
contained and that no case in the suite had been exercising the wrong order -
the second being why 353 green cases never noticed.

`tests/cases/lookup-order.cpp` pins which scope owns the name in ten shapes: a
parameter and a local against an enumerator, a member against a global reached
directly and through both kinds of capture, a local against a member, a class
enumerator against a global, and a local against a class enumerator.

## What the 2026-09-06 register found, and where each root stands

**`docs/audit-2026-09-06.html` is frozen and is not edited as things are
fixed** - the rule the 2026-09-01 audit set, and for its reason: a later reader
can tell what was true on the day from what is true now only if nobody quietly
brings the report up to date. The state lives here, in the table the earlier
audit's findings already use.

Three Fable 5.1 reviewers found about eighty-five defects under four suites
that were green on all three machines, and they collapse into five roots.

| | Root | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Unqualified lookup asks the three scopes in nearly the reverse order - an enumerator hides a local and a parameter, a global hides a data member | **fixed** 2026-09-06, `f4764fb` |
| R2 | A *written* destructor destroys none of the class's members or bases; the implicit one always did | **fixed** 2026-09-06, `7220d47` |
| R3 | A by-value capture of a class is copied bytewise and never destroyed; of an array, reads garbage | **fixed** 2026-09-06, `e28f2a6` |
| R4 | Eight nested-parse doors, each with its own hand-written save list; six fields missing from one and six leaking from another | **fixed** 2026-09-06, `e28f2a6` |
| R5 | Access control asked from the wrong class, in both directions - protected base members refused, private base members reached | **fixed** 2026-09-06, `e28f2a6` |

**Three defects the register does not contain were found by fixing it**, each
one door over from a repair, and each is in the commits above: a local class's
constructor and destructor carried no enclosing-function wrapper, so two
functions each declaring `struct L` produced one symbol and the assembler
refused the file - valid C++11 that predates lambdas entirely; a `Member`
carried its access but no record of which class declared it; and a
new-expression's constructor had no access check at all.

**What the register lists and the roots do not cover** is the tail: fourteen
refusals of ordinary code, twenty-seven over-acceptances, the `_ZTS` assembler
failure for a polymorphic class template. Those were not worked item by item on
purpose - fixing a root tends to close several - and the honest next step is to
re-measure with review C's 306-program corpus rather than to assume they went
with the roots.

**A fifth defect was found after the register and is not in it.** The Windows
stack-probe crash - a frame of six pages taken in one `sub`, past the guard
page - was found by running `matrix_main.cpp` on the Windows box, not by any of
the three reviewers. It is recorded under "A frame that skipped the guard page"
rather than here, and the distinction is worth keeping rather than tidying
away: the register is what three reviewers found by reading and probing the
compiler, and this is what a real program found by being run on a third
machine. Filing it as an audit finding would credit the wrong oracle and hide
the fact that **the reviews did not catch it** - none of the 306 differential
programs had a frame that large, and neither did any of the 375 suite cases.

**One finding is explicitly not fixed and is not a remainder of any root.**
Inside a namespace an unqualified name still finds the global one first,
because `findGlobal` tries the flat table before `qualifyForLookup`. It is
recorded in `docs/CONFORMANCE.md`, it is R1's neighbour rather than part of it,
and reversing that order changes how every unqualified name in a namespace
resolves - which wants a round of its own.

## V-09, the finding with no root, and the register that holds the tail now

**One of the nine hand-verified findings in `docs/audit-2026-09-06.html` carries
no `Root:` line**, and that is how it outlived the round that closed the other
eight. R1 to R5 each name their findings; V-09 names a source line and nothing
else, so it belonged to no root, was not in the tail either, and the table above
never mentioned it. Fixed 2026-09-09, three days after the rest.

**[expr.prim.lambda]/18: the captured `this` has the type it has in the
enclosing function.** In a const member function that is `const S *`, and cxx1
captured the unqualified class - so a const member function could write its own
object through a lambda, and call its own non-const members, with no
diagnostic. Both halves were needed and either alone leaves the hole open:

- the capture takes the type `this` has here, which `findLocal("this")` already
  carries - `pointerTo(withConst(memberOf))` is what `topLevel` gave it - rather
  than `pointerTo(currentClass_)`;
- and the member reached through that pointer inherits its const, which is the
  same two-exception rule the `.`, `->` and implicit paths follow and this one
  path did not: a reference member and a `mutable` one are unaffected.

`insideAccessOf` compares the recorded class by pointer, so it asks for the
`unqualified()` one now - a const-qualified `Type *` is a different pointer, and
without that line a lambda in a const member function loses the access its
enclosing function has.

**Six of 991 emitted files changed, all three of them one case.** The case is
`lookup-order`, on the const-member path this fixes, and the whole diff is one
redundant sign-extension leaving - `sxtw x0, w0` after an `ldrsw` that has
already done it. Measured the way this file asks: golden recorded at HEAD, the
fix applied, the suite re-run.

Six shapes are measured against clang and agree: reading a member and calling a
const member from a const function's lambda, writing a `mutable` member from
one, writing an ordinary member from a lambda in a non-const function, and the
two that must now be refused. `tests/cases/lambda-capture-this-const.cpp` holds
the first four, and the refusals are their own cases, one per rule.

### And the tail is a directory rather than a paragraph

The section above says the tail - fourteen refusals of ordinary code,
twenty-seven over-acceptances, the `_ZTS` failure - was not worked item by item
and should be re-measured rather than assumed closed. Fifteen of those shapes
were re-measured on 2026-09-09 at `48f28a3`, one program each. **All fifteen
still reproduced**, so nothing in the tail went with the roots; V-09 was the
fifteenth and is the one now fixed.

The other fourteen are `tests/open/`, and `tests/open.sh` runs them against a
recorded clang answer and **gates on nothing**, the way `tests/corpus.sh` does.
The reason it cannot gate is the reason the tail was invisible in the first
place: a known wrong answer put in `tests/cases` turns three boxes red until
somebody mends it, and one written down only in prose is a claim
`tools/exclusions` cannot see and no run will ever print. A third place, which
is counted, is the answer to both.

**A closed entry does not stay there.** When cxx1 starts agreeing with the
`.clang` file beside a program, `open.sh` names it and says to move it into
`tests/cases` with its `.expected` or `.error`; a register that keeps its
mended entries stops being a list of what is wrong.

Two of the fourteen are worth knowing by name. `int z(5);` - parenthesised
direct-init of a scalar - is refused, and this tree's own `include/utility`
writes it, so `std::swap` on two `int`s fails *inside the header*. And
`catch-return-end-catch.cpp` is the one that needs the ledger rather than a
trace: leaving a handler by `return` never calls `__cxa_end_catch`, so the
exception object is never destroyed - cxx1 prints `built=2 gone=1 live=1` where
clang prints `built=1 gone=1 live=0`, with **identical output above the ledger
line**. That is the register's own rule about elision, and the argument for
`tests/cases/lifetime.h` made a second time.

## A capture-default takes `this` as well, and both of them do

**Fixed 2026-09-09, and it is the first entry `tests/open/` closed** - written
into that directory in the morning and moved out of it the same day, which is
the movement the register was built for.

**[expr.prim.lambda]/8**: `[=]` and `[&]` capture `this` implicitly where the
body names a member, and *both* capture the pointer. `[=, *this]`, which copies
the object, is C++17 and is not what `[=]` has ever meant. So the shape most
lambdas inside a class are written in - `[=]() { return n; }` - did not compile
here at all, while `[this]` written out worked: the scan that finds a
capture-default's captures looks for names that are **locals of the enclosing
function**, and a member is not one. The message even said so, `'n' is not a
local of the function around this lambda`, which named the right thing and the
wrong rule.

**Three lines decide it and each is a rule rather than a special case.** A
scanned name that is neither a local nor an enclosing closure's capture is
asked whether it is this class's own - `namesOwnMember`, a data member or a
member function, its bases' included, and false inside a closure's own call
operator where `currentClass_` is the closure. If any name answers yes the
pointer is taken **once, after the scan**: one `this` however many members the
body reads, and none where `[this]` was written out already.

**The const half came free, and only because V-09 was fixed first.** The
implicit capture asks `capturedThisClass()` for its type - the same helper the
written `[this]` now uses, which reads the enclosing `this` rather than
`currentClass_`, so in a const member function it is `const S *`. Building it
from `currentClass_` would have re-opened V-09 through a second door;
`lambda-capture-default-this-refused.cpp` is the case that would have caught
that, and clang refuses the same program in the same place.

`lambda-capture-default-this.cpp` pins six shapes, all agreeing with clang
byte for byte: a data member through `[=]`, a const member function called
from a const function's `[=]`, a member written through `[&]`, a local of the
same name as a member shadowing it, an inherited member, and a local and two
members in one body. **No emitted file moved**: the three that changed in this
round's golden are the `lookup-order` of the V-09 commit, and the six added are
these two cases' own.

**What is next door and still open** is `tests/open/lambda-class-scope-names`,
which looks like this one and is not: a lambda body naming a class's `static`
member or enumerator needs no `this` at all - [expr.prim.lambda]/7 puts the
body in the enclosing function's scope, and the lookup walks `currentClass_`,
which inside the call operator is the closure. Nothing here touches it.

## A class template's three symbols, and the name they could not spell

**Fixed 2026-09-09**, the second entry `tests/open/` closed. A virtual function
in a class template needs the class's name in three symbols - `_ZTV`, `_ZTI`
and the `_ZTS` string the second points at - and all three were built by
`itaniumClassNameString(tag)`, which counts the letters of the display tag.
For `P<int>` that is `6P<int>`, and it reaches the assembler as it stands:

```
  .globl _ZTS6P<int>
```

**So every polymorphic class template stopped in the assembler**, one step past
a compiler that thought it had succeeded. The Microsoft side had the same
shape, `??_7P<int>@@6B@` where cl writes `??_7?$P@H@@6B@`.

**The fix is not to sanitise the angle brackets.** Nothing is escaped in an ABI
name: the arguments are *encoded*, `1PIiE` and `?$P@H@`, and a name with `<`
replaced by `_` would link against nothing and would collide - `P<int>` and
`P_int_` are one name after such a substitution. The encoding already existed,
because the mangler spells such a type wherever one is written in a signature;
these three symbols now ask it, and a tag with no `<` in it takes the old path
untouched, which is why **no emitted file moved** - 0 of 757 changed, 3 added,
those being the new case's own.

Measured against clang, and each shape is a different part of the encoding:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `_ZTS1PIiE` | a type argument |
| `_ZTS3BoxIiLi3EE` | a non-type argument |
| `_ZTS6HolderIS_IiEE` | an argument that is a specialization of the same template, which takes a substitution |
| `_ZTSN2ns1RIiEE` | one in a namespace |
| `??_7?$P@H@@6B@` | the Microsoft vftable |

### The namespace wrapper, which the same measurement found

**Two older bugs came out of that last row, one per ABI, and neither is about
type_info at all** - both are ordinary linkage names that a program linking
against a real library would get wrong.

On Itanium a specialization in a namespace was written as a bare template-id:
`_Z1f2ns1RIiE` where clang writes `_Z1fN2ns1RIiEE`. The `N...E` wrapper is what
every other nested name carries, and the branch above this one already writes
it for a plain class in a namespace. **`std` is the exception the ABI itself
makes** - `St3vecIiE` has no wrapper - which is exactly why nothing showed it:
the only namespaced specializations this tree had were `std::initializer_list`
and its neighbours, and they were right.

On the Microsoft side the namespace was missing altogether: `?$R@H@@` where cl
writes `?$R@H@ns@@`. **Twelve emitted files moved on that one**, all
x86_64-windows and all specializations in a namespace - `lib::box<int>` became
`??0?$box@H@lib@@QEAA@AEBH@Z` where it had been `??0?$box@H@@QEAA@AEBH@Z`, and
every `std::` one the same way. None of them was under a `names.sh` comparison
that could have said so: each carries a `.nonames` for the COMDAT difference,
which skips the case for every target at once. The cause is the same in both - **a specialization carries
its namespace beside the template's name rather than in its tag**, so
`inNamespace()` is false for it and the loop that pushes scopes had nothing to
push. There is no `St` abbreviation there; `std` is spelled `std@` like any
other scope.

Both were found by `tests/names.sh` on a case written for the type_info bug,
which is the argument for that suite in one sentence: the case was about
`_ZTS`, and it caught two names that had nothing to do with it.

### What the case cannot cover, and what it found on the way

`polymorphic-class-template.cpp` carries a `.nonames` for x86_64-linux only,
and for the reason several other cases do - clang emits only the C2 and D2
forms of a constructor defined inside its class there. The other cases answer
that by defining the constructor out of line; this one cannot, an out-of-line
constructor of a class template being one of the four gaps met writing
`<type_traits>`.

**And a Windows defect no case had reached**, found by this one failing on the
box: a function *other than `main`* that owns an unwind region emits a `.pdata`
entry pointing at `$cppxdata$<its mangled name>` and never lays that label
down, so ml64 answers `A2006: undefined symbol`. The shape that reaches it is
an ordinary one - a constructor taking a class **by value**, which on the
Microsoft ABI the callee destroys, so the parameter needs a cleanup:

```cpp
struct G { S v; G(S x) : v(x) {} };      // ml64: A2006 $cppxdata$??0G@@QEAA@US@@@Z
```

It is not about templates and not about this round: the same program without a
template does it, and a scan of all 991 golden files found **no existing case
that emits such a reference at all**, which is why nothing had caught it.
`main` is the exception because its own `$cppxdata$main` *is* defined. The case
here takes its parameter by `const T &` to stay about names, and this is
written down rather than fixed in a round that was measuring manglings.

Writing it found a third thing, now `tests/open/mem-init-template-id-base.cpp`:
**a mem-initialiser naming a template-id base does not parse** - `D(int x) :
P<int>(x) {}` is answered "expected '('" at the `<`. So a class deriving from a
specialization cannot pass its base an argument, which is why the case's
polymorphism is exercised through a reference to `P<int>` rather than through a
derived class.

## Every way out of a handler ends the catch, and only one of them did

**Fixed 2026-09-09**, the third entry `tests/open/` closed and the last of the
three raised that morning. `__cxa_end_catch` - the call that pops the runtime's
caught-exception chain and destroys the exception object - was appended *after*
the handler's block, so **falling off the end was the only way out that made
it.** `catch (E &e) { return e.v; }` branched straight to the return with the
chain still set and the object never destroyed: one leaked exception object per
call, the right answer printed, and nothing in stdout to see it by.

```
cxx1   built=2 gone=1 live=1        clang   built=1 gone=1 live=0
```

**A jump makes the call itself now, once per handler it leaves**, and the count
is the whole of the design. `handlerDepth_` says how many handlers the
statement is inside; two vectors beside it say what the loop and switch depth
were when each was entered, which is what tells a `break` that leaves a handler
from one that does not:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `return` | leaves every open handler - `handlerDepth_` of them |
| `break`, `continue` | leaves the run of handlers entered *after* the loop or switch being left, counted from the innermost out |
| a loop inside the handler | leaves none, and gets no call |
| `goto` | refused, and the reason is below |

**The value is saved before the catch ends, and that is not tidiness.**
`return e.v;` reads the caught object, which `__cxa_end_catch` destroys - so the
returned value goes into a frame slot, then the destructors run, then the
catches end, then the frame slot is returned. The path that did that already
existed for a function that owes destructors; it is now also taken when a
handler is open.

**Order within it: locals first, exception object after.** [except.handle]/16
destroys the handler's own objects on the way out and the exception object when
the handling ends, so `emitDestructors` runs and `endCatches` follows it.
`catch (E e)` - by value - is the shape that shows it, and both compilers report
the same two objects and two destructions there, elision having nothing to take.

### `goto` is refused, and the reason is where the decision is made

A forward label has not been read when the `goto` is parsed: `resolveGotos`
fills the jump's cleanup block afterwards, by which time the statement is
built and there is nowhere to put the call. So a `goto` that leaves a handler
is **refused by name** rather than left to leak, and a `goto` to a label the
handler itself declares - which leaves nothing - still compiles. The test for
"inside this handler" is the label's own position against the handler's first
token.

### The Microsoft side keeps the counters and uses them to refuse

There is no `__cxa_end_catch` on that ABI: a handler is a funclet and the
runtime ends the catch when it returns. `return` inside one was already refused
there - leaving a funclet early means handing back the address to carry on at,
in the register a return value would travel in - and **`break` and `continue`
out of one were not, though they are the same jump**. They are now, by the same
counters, and a `break` whose loop is inside the handler is still allowed. That
hole was invisible until the counters existed to see it.

### What this does not fix

**An exception thrown *out* of a handler still does not end the catch**: the
region around the handler has no cleanup that calls `__cxa_end_catch`, so a
`throw` from inside one leaves the chain set. Every jump this section is about
is a jump the parser writes; that one is the unwinder's path and wants a
cleanup row, which is the same work `noexcept` over a body wanted. Also
recorded, from `names.sh` on the new case: cxx1 emits neither
`__cxa_free_exception` - clang's cleanup for a throw whose object's own
constructor throws - nor `__cxa_get_exception_ptr`, which the ABI asks for
before `__cxa_begin_catch` when a by-value parameter is copy-initialised.

## A `throw` out of a handler, which is the one exit the parser cannot write

**Fixed 2026-09-09**, and it is the half `handler-exit-end-catch` left open.
Every jump out of a handler ends the catch for itself now; an **exception**
leaving one cannot, because the unwinder takes that path and no statement is
executed on it. So `__cxa_end_catch` never ran, the runtime's caught-exception
chain stayed set and the object was never destroyed - `live=1` per call, with
the same output above the ledger line.

**The handler's block becomes a cleanup region of its own**, and its pad calls
`__cxa_end_catch`. That is what clang emits: an invoke of `__cxa_throw` with a
cleanup landing pad beside it. Everything needed for the region already
existed - `openRegion` splits whatever encloses it, so the rows stay disjoint,
and `visit(Try)` puts the enclosing handlers on the row's action chain.

**Only where the block can throw.** `mayThrow_` counts calls and throws the way
the `noexcept` region does, and a handler that calls nothing gets no region -
which is why 20 of 762 emitted files moved rather than every case with a
`catch` in it.

### Where the pad hands over, and the leak that taught it

The pad ends *this* catch and then has to reach whatever is outside it. Three
answers, innermost first, and `unwindTarget` is the one place that decides:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| a handler's own end-catch pad | another `catch` is open around this one, and its catch has to be ended too |
| the enclosing `try`'s chain | that chain is the only place the selector is tested for those types |
| nothing | `_Unwind_Resume`, which leaves for the caller |

**The first row is the one that had to be learned.** The first version jumped
straight to the enclosing `try`'s chain, which is right for a handler directly
inside a `try` and wrong the moment a handler sits inside another handler: the
jump went past the outer handler's pad and ended one catch of the two.
`twoDeep` in the case is that shape, and the ledger read `live=1` while every
printed value was correct. So a handler's pad is named - `$endcatch<n>`, the
same `$` trick `$chain` uses - and an inner region hands to it rather than past
it. A `try` **body** inside a handler still answers with its own chain, which
is one step in front; the chain's own end then hands to the handler's pad.

**And the pad owes the objects outside the `try`.** A `try` is covered by no
enclosing cleanup region - it answers for itself, and its chain destroys them
where nothing matched - so a pad inside its handler is the last row in the
frame and has to run those destructors too. Measured as a leak of a local
declared *before* the `try` whose handler threw: `~A` never ran, and clang's
order is the exception object first and then that local, which is what this
emits.

### And the exclusion it lifted, which is why the region was worth building

**A local with a destructor inside a `catch` handler compiles now**, on both
Itanium targets, and it was refused for exactly the reason this region
removes: a handler is emitted past the `try`'s range, so its block was inside
no row - nothing to carry the `try`'s catch types on, and no chain to hand the
selector to. The end-catch region *is* that row, and a local's destructor goes
in the same pad, in front of the call that ends the catch. Two lines did it
once the region existed: `wrapCleanups` asks `unwindTarget` where to hand over
instead of asking for the enclosing `try`'s chain by name, and the refusal
went.

**Nothing else moved** - 0 of 764 emitted files, because no case in the tree
had a local in a handler; they could not, it was refused. `local-in-handler.cpp`
is the case, six shapes against clang: falling off the end, a `throw` past the
local, a `return` past it, two locals with a block between them, a `continue`
out of a handler in a loop, and a handler that throws while its local is alive
into an enclosing `try`. **x86_64-windows keeps the refusal**, function-wide
and for all three shapes - a cleanup there is a funclet and an FH3 state, and
`wrapMsCleanups` has been taught none of it. `local-in-handler-refused.cpp` was
a `.error` case and is now `local-in-handler.cpp` with an `.expected`.

### What the case covers, and the two names clang has that this does not

`throw-out-of-handler.cpp` pins eight shapes against clang: a new exception out
of one handler, `throw;`, an enclosing `try` in the same function catching it,
one that does not match, two-deep handlers, a local outside the `try`, catch by
value, and `catch (...)` rethrowing. Every value agrees and the balance is
zero on both sides.

`names.sh` records two runtime calls clang makes and cxx1 does not:
`__cxa_free_exception`, the cleanup for a throw whose *object's own
constructor* throws, and `__cxa_get_exception_ptr`, which the ABI asks for
before `__cxa_begin_catch` when a by-value parameter is copy-initialised. cxx1
copies through the pointer `__cxa_begin_catch` returns, which is the same
pointer. Neither changes what any program here does; both are written down
rather than left to be rediscovered.

## The two runtime calls clang made and this did not, and the bug behind one

**Fixed 2026-09-09.** `names.sh` had recorded both as clang-only for as long as
there were exception cases to compare, in a `.nonames` that said what they were
for. Writing that file down is what made them findable; both are gone now, and
so are the three markers - **every name in those cases agrees with clang**.

### `__cxa_free_exception`, and the temporary that is not an object

**[except.throw]/4: storage the initialisation never finishes with is freed.**
`__cxa_allocate_exception` hands back the room for the exception object and
nothing owns it until `__cxa_throw` is reached - so a copy constructor that
throws on the way in leaked the whole object, once per throw, invisibly.

**The first version of the fix was a region of its own around the copy**, which
is what clang emits, and it was wrong here: the region split the enclosing
cleanup's range and its pad handed straight over, so a *local* alive beside the
`throw` stopped being destroyed. Measured, `live=1` where HEAD had `live=0`,
and the tree's own rule caught it - `git stash`, rebuild, and the leak was
mine.

**The storage is a temporary of the throw's full expression, and saying so is
the whole fix.** Every cleanup pad already walks the block's temporaries under
a guard flag; this one is released with `__cxa_free_exception` rather than a
destructor. So the region that frees it is the region that was going to run
anyway, in order with everything else it destroys, and nothing new decides
where to hand over. The guard is set after the allocation and **cleared before
`__cxa_throw`**, because from that call on the runtime owns the storage and a
pad unwinding *this* exception must not give it back.

`releaseTemporary` is where the two kinds meet, and it is one function now
rather than the same fifteen lines in `wrapMsCleanups` and `cleanupPad`.

### `__cxa_get_exception_ptr`, and what catching by value was doing

**The call is the smaller half.** [except.handle]/3 copy-*initialises* the
handler's parameter from the exception object, and cxx1 assigned the bytes: no
copy constructor ran, and **the parameter was never destroyed**. A class owning
a buffer handed the handler a second pointer to it; a copy constructor with a
refcount or a log was skipped.

**The ledger balanced the whole time**, which is why it survived: the copy this
compiler does not elide at the `throw` is one construction and one destruction
too many, and the missing parameter copy and destroy are one of each too few.
They cancelled. `built` and `gone` moved by one in two cases when this landed,
and both were re-recorded.

The parameter is an object of the handler's scope now - copy-constructed where
there is a constructor, entered in `alive_`, and destroyed by every way out:
a jump through `emitDestructors`, an exception through the end-catch pad, and
falling off the end. **Before the catch ends, in each of them**, which is the
order [except.handle]/16 asks for. It is taken out of `alive_` at the end of
the handler, or the block around the `try` would destroy it a second time.

**And that is what the ABI call is for**: `__cxa_get_exception_ptr` hands back
the adjusted pointer *before* `__cxa_begin_catch`, so the catch is not entered
until the copy has been made. Measured from clang, and the measurement mattered
twice: only a class with a **copy constructor** gets the call - `catch (int)`
and a trivially copyable class take the pointer `__cxa_begin_catch` returns, as
this always did. The first version called it for every by-value catch and
`names.sh` said so on seven cases at once.

**What is still open**, and now `tests/open/catch-copy-throws.cpp`: if that
copy constructor throws, [except.handle]/3 calls `std::terminate` and clang
emits `__clang_call_terminate` around the copy. cxx1 lets the exception leave,
so the enclosing handler catches it.

## `int z(5);`, and the question the parser was asking instead

**Fixed 2026-09-09.** Direct-initialisation of a scalar - [dcl.init]/16 - read
as a parameter list and answered `expected a type` at the 5. A class with a
constructor had this since rung 3; nothing else did, and **this tree's own
`<utility>` writes `T held(a);`**, so `std::swap` on two `int`s failed inside
the header. Two entries of `tests/open/` closed on one change.

**[dcl.ambig.res]/1 decides it: anything that can be a declaration is one.** So
the only question is whether what follows the `(` could begin a parameter, and
there is one place that asks it now - `atParenInitialiser` - where there were
three copies of a similar test and a fourth was about to be written. It says
*parameter list* for an empty pair, an ellipsis, `static`, `register`, `auto`,
and anything `atTypeName` recognises; everything else is an expression, which
makes it an initialiser.

**And the old copies were asking the wrong question**, which is what the new
name is for. They called `atDeclarationStart`, which answers "is this
*statement* a declaration" - and that one says **no** to `T()`, because
`P().get();` is an expression statement. Inside parentheses `T()` is a
parameter of function type, so `S s(T());` is the **most vexing parse**: a
function declaration, which is what clang reads and what cxx1 now reads.
Before this it built an object, silently, and the class path had been doing
that since rung 3. `names.sh` is what caught it - `?vexing@@3US@@A`, a data
symbol where clang has a function.

Four callers share the helper: a local, a file-scope object, `auto`'s
deduction, and the class-with-no-constructor path that already existed. `auto
z(5);` needed the deduction to look inside the parentheses for the type, and
**`int f(auto x)` needed the answer to stay "parameter list"** or its
`is C++14` refusal turns into `expected an expression` - which is how that
keyword got onto the list.

**A condition is refused**, and by name: [stmt.select]/1 gives a condition its
own grammar, `= expr` or braces, and clang refuses `if (int a(5))` too. A
scalar given two initialisers is refused the same way - `int b(1, 2);` has
nothing for the second to initialise.

**No emitted file moved.** 0 of 766, because everything this touches was
refused before it could be emitted; the six added are the new cases' own.

## Six refusals in one round, and the boundary each of them has

**2026-09-09.** Six entries of `tests/open/` were **over-acceptances** -
programs clang refuses and cxx1 compiled - and they are closed together. Each
is a rule with a citation and a message that gives it; what took the time was
not the rules but the shapes *next* to them, which is where a refusal one case
too wide would have landed.

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auto a = 1, b = 2.0;` | [dcl.spec.auto]/7 | one `auto`, one type |
| `struct S { const int a; }; S s;` | [class.ctor]/5 | the implicit default constructor is deleted |
| `struct S { int S(); };` | [class.ctor]/3 | a constructor has no return type |
| `struct S { int a; int a; };` | [class.mem]/1 | one member of each name |
| `(constS.*p) = 3;` | [expr.mptr.oper]/6 | the result is const where the object is |
| `int operator+(int, int);` | [over.oper]/6 | an operator needs a class or enumeration parameter |

**Each was doing something quietly wrong rather than nothing.** The `auto`
declaration gave `b` an `int` holding 2 where the initialiser said `2.0`. The
const member began life holding the frame, with a const promising it would not
change. `int S()` became a member function nothing could call, and `S s;` went
on using the implicit default constructor. The duplicate member laid out two
places and read the *last* - `findMember` walks backwards so a derived member
hides a base's - leaving the first unnameable. `.*` on a const object was
V-09's hole one operator over. And the operator over two `int`s sat in the
object as a symbol nothing referred to, because resolution on `1 + 2` takes the
built-in.

### The boundaries, and the one that was wrong first

`refusals-that-must-not-fire.cpp` is the case that holds them, six legal shapes
standing beside the six refusals, and it exists because **one of the rules was
too wide when first written**:

```cpp
auto *p = &a, q = 5;      // legal: `auto` is int in both
```

The first version compared the *declarator's* type - `int *` against `int` -
and refused a conforming program. [dcl.spec.auto]/7 is about what `auto`
deduced, not about what each declarator built, so `deduceAutoFrom` records the
binding it made and the declaration loops compare that. Caught by writing the
legal case, not by the suites, which had nothing of the shape.

The other five boundaries: a member **hiding a base's** is ordinary C++, so
only names declared in this class are compared and `ownFrom` is where the
copied ones stop; a const member **with an initialiser** is fine, and so is a
class with a **written constructor**, which has no implicit default to delete;
reading through a const object with `.*` and `->*` still works, only writing is
refused; and an operator over a **class** or an **enumeration** is exactly what
[over.oper]/6 asks for, either one.

**A class with a base is left alone** by the const-member rule on purpose: the
member list here is flattened, base members and all, so refusing on one would
be a guess about which class it came from.

**Nothing emitted moved** - 0 of 772 files - because every one of these is a
program that now stops at the front end.

## A two-dimensional array member, built twice over its first row

**Fixed 2026-09-09**, and it was the only *miscompile* in `tests/open/` - the
rest of that register was refusals of legal code and acceptances of illegal.
`struct H { E g[2][3]; };` constructed **two** objects where [class.base.init]/8
asks for six, and the four it skipped began life holding the frame:

```
cxx1   + + | 1            clang   + + + + + + | 1
```

**Three walks had the same line and the same mistake** - the one that builds an
array member, the one that copies or assigns it, and the one that destroys it.
Each took `mt->length()` for a count and `mt->pointee()` for an element, which
for `E[2][3]` is *two* and `E[3]`: two constructor calls, stepping by the size
of a **row**, so both landed inside the first row. The copy copied two rows'
worth of bytes as two elements and the destructor destroyed two.

**A local array of the same type was right the whole time.**
`constructLocalArray` multiplies every dimension, which is what made this look
like a class problem rather than an array one. `memberElements` is that walk
written once, and the three sites read it.

**No emitted file moved** - 0 of 775 - which is the measurement that says why
this survived: **no case in the tree had a multi-dimensional array member.**
`array-member-dimensions.cpp` has four now, and counts them: a `[2][3]`, a
`[2][2][2]`, a class mixing a scalar with a single, a row and a grid, and a
scalar `int[2][3]` with nothing to build. Both compilers report **42 objects
built and 42 destroyed**, so what agrees is the count and not only the balance.

## The GNU spelling is x86_64-windows's default now, and COMDAT is why

**Decided 2026-09-10**, and it is the open item the 09-09 handover left as
"make `-masm=gnu` the Windows default, or decide not to". What settled it was
not the line table: it was that **`ml64` cannot link a C++ program of more than
one file**.

**The chain, measured rather than reasoned.** A member function defined inside
its class is a strong symbol in every object that includes the header - this
tree's own `<string>` defines its members that way - and folding them needs a
COMDAT section. `ml64` has **no directive that reaches the COMDAT bit at all**.
So two objects that both include `<string>` do not link, and `link.exe` answers
`LNK2005` once per duplicate. Found by building `examples/` on the box: three
translation units, and the second one duplicated `std::string::assignFrom`,
`appendBytes` and `reserveExactly`.

**The GNU spelling already emitted them.** `CoffSpelling::functionBegin` takes
a `mergeable` flag and writes `.section .text,"xr",discard,"<sym>"` - 123 such
sections in one file of that example, vtables and inline functions alike, which
is what cl's own objects carry. Nothing had to be written; the default had to
move.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| what it buys | a multi-file program links; `-g` works, that spelling being the only one with a line table |
| what it costs | a clang on the Windows machine - Visual Studio 2022 ships one as an optional component, and this tree has assembled through it since `6a6813f` |
| what it moved | 245 of 778 emitted goldens, all x86_64-windows, re-recorded |
| what is kept | `-masm=masm` for a machine with no clang, at one translation unit per program - `examples/unity.cpp` is that build |

**"GNU spelling" is a syntax and not a toolchain**, which is worth saying in
the tree because the name misleads: clang reads it and writes an ordinary
MSVC-ABI COFF object, `link.exe` links it against the Microsoft CRT, and
nothing of MinGW or a GNU runtime is anywhere near it.

**The version went to 1.2 rather than re-sealing 1.1.** A seal names a set of
sources; 1.1 named one and this is not it.

## `LNK4078`, and a section name that folded into the wrong one

**Fixed 2026-09-10.** Every Windows link printed

```
warning LNK4078: multiple '.data' sections found with different attributes (40400040)
```

and it was one character of section name. The Microsoft RTTI records - the type
descriptor, the class hierarchy, the base array and the locator - went into
**`.data$r`**. The linker groups a section by the part *before* its `$`, so
that folded into `.data`, which is writable; the records are read-only, and
40400040 is initialised-data-read-and-align-8 with no write bit. Two attribute
sets for one section is exactly what LNK4078 says.

**cl puts them in `.rdata$r`**, which folds into `.rdata` where read-only is
what everything else is. Measured with `dumpbin /headers` on cl's own object
rather than reasoned about: `.rdata$r`, flags `40401040`. Both spellings write
that now - the GNU one's `.section .rdata$r,"dr"` and MASM's
`.rdata$r SEGMENT READONLY` - and the warning is gone from both, with the
programs still running.

**30 of 778 emitted files moved**, all x86_64-windows, all of them a class with
a vftable. Nothing else in the object changed: the records, their contents and
their symbol names are what they were, and `names-vs-cl` still agrees on 172.

## `$cppxdata$`, and a question asked of the wrong witness

**Fixed 2026-09-10.** A function other than `main` that owned an unwind region
emitted `DD imagerel $cppxdata$<its name>` into its Microsoft unwind info and
never wrote that label, so ml64 stopped with `A2006: undefined symbol`. The
shape that reaches it is ordinary - a constructor taking a class **by value**,
which on that ABI the callee destroys, so the function owes a destructor on the
exceptional path and cxx1 gives it a landing pad.

**Two places decided the same thing and one of them could not know.** The GNU
spelling was told by the code generator - `noteHasEh(!msTries().empty())`,
written the moment the tables are about to be emitted, with a comment saying
its unwind info must not name a FuncInfo that never appears. The MASM spelling
was never told: that call sat behind `!emitsOwnRtti()`, which is about who
writes the RTTI records and has nothing to do with exception tables. So
`MasmSpelling::prologue` decided for itself, from whether the **Itanium** LSDA
name it is handed was empty - and that says a landing pad exists, not that a
Microsoft table will be written for it.

The guard is gone, `MasmSpelling` takes the note like the other spelling, and
the prologue decides nothing. One signal, one place.

**No golden moved** - 0 of 778 - which is the measurement that says why this
lasted: **no case in the tree had the shape.** `by-value.cpp` passes classes by
value, and none of them has a destructor, which is exactly what makes the
callee owe one. `by-value-parameter-unwind.cpp` has it now, in a constructor
and in a plain function, and both spellings compile, assemble, link and run it
on the box.

## The Microsoft virtual-base layout, measured

**2026-09-10, and this is measurement rather than implementation** - the
feature is not written, and what stopped it before was that nobody had asked
cl. Now somebody has, so the next attempt starts from facts.

**A virtual base goes at the end of the most-derived object, and every
subobject that introduces one carries its own `vbptr`.** Measured with cl,
sizes and offsets read off real objects rather than from a null pointer - a
virtual base's member cannot be reached through `((T *)0x1000)->m` at all,
because the compiler must load the vbptr to find it, which is itself the
lesson:

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `struct V { int a; };` | 4 | |
| `struct D1 : virtual V { int b; };` | **24** | vbptr 0, `b` 8, **V at 16** |
| `struct Dia : D1, D2 { int d; };` | **48** | D1 at 0, D2 at 16 with its *own* vbptr, `d` 32, **the one V at 40** |
| `struct P : virtual W { int e; };` | **32** | vbptr 0, `e` 8, W (polymorphic, 16) at 16 |
| `struct Plain : V { int b; };` | 8 | a non-virtual base is unchanged |

**The table is four-byte entries and the first one is the vbptr's own offset.**
`??_8D1@@7B@ DD 00H, DD 010H` - zero, then 16, which is V measured from the
vbptr. One table per (class, vbptr) pair, named for the subobject it serves:
`??_8Dia@@7BD1@@@` and `??_8Dia@@7BD2@@@`.

**The constructor stores them.** `lea rcx, OFFSET FLAT:??_8D1@@7B@` then
`mov QWORD PTR [rax], rcx`, and Dia's constructor does it twice - at `[rax]`
for its D1 and at `[rax+16]` for its D2.

### What implementing it would take, and why the shape matters

`hasVptr()` is `polymorphic() || hasVirtualBase()`, which is **Itanium's**
rule: there the vtable carries the `vbase_offset`, so one pointer answers both
questions. On this ABI they are two pointers - a vfptr for virtual functions
and a vbptr for virtual bases - and conflating them is why a class with no
virtual function at all is turned away with *"has virtual functions in a base
that is not the first"*. Five things follow, and none of them is small:

1. a `vbptr` distinct from the vfptr, in the layout and in `Type`;
2. virtual bases placed **after** everything else, once per most-derived object;
3. a vbtable emitted per subobject that introduces one, in both Windows
   spellings;
4. every constructor storing them, at each subobject's own offset;
5. member access and casts reading the table rather than a fixed offset.

**Half of that is worse than none of it**: a layout that is right for `sizeof`
and wrong for one offset miscompiles silently, where today the compiler refuses
by name. So it is one round or none, and this section is where that round
starts.

## A frame that skipped the guard page, and two wrong answers before it

**Fixed 2026-09-06.** `matrix_main.cpp` of the C++ Vector Exercise died on
x86_64-windows with 0xC0000005 and ran on the other two targets. The cause is
in the subsection below - a frame of six pages taken in one `sub`, past the
guard page Windows commits the stack through - and cxx1's Windows prologues
now probe with `__chkstk` as cl does for any frame of a page or more.

**What is kept here is the road to it, because two published answers were
wrong before that one was right**, and both were wrong the same way. The
first named `(CMatrix<>)a`, a class template-id with defaulted arguments, on
the evidence that rewriting that one token made the crash go away - but the
rewrite went to a file with a different *name*, so two things changed at once.
The second named the length of that filename, which reaches the program only
through `assert`'s `__FILE__`, on the evidence of this table:

    name length  9  exit 0        13  0xC0000005
                10  0xC0000005    14  exit 0
                11  exit 0        15  exit 0
                12  exit 0        16  exit 0

**Every entry in that table is a single run of a nondeterministic crash.** The
same binary, run twelve times, crashed eleven and passed once. So the table
measured luck, the "control" that disproved the first answer was luck, and the
six careful reductions that all passed on Windows passed by luck too.

**The rule that would have caught it in the first ten minutes: run the same
binary twice.** A bisect is a sequence of one-run measurements, and against an
intermittent fault it produces a confident, detailed, entirely fictional
answer - which is exactly what it produced, twice.

### It was never the string: a frame that skipped the guard page

**Fixed 2026-09-06, and the characterisation above is wrong in its premise.**
The length table was one run per name, and the defect is not deterministic:
`rep.cmd`, twelve runs of *one* `spell2_8.exe`, gave eleven crashes and one
clean exit with the full 254 bytes of output. Every "exit 0" in that table is
a lucky run and every 0xC0000005 an unlucky one, and the string's length was
never a variable at all. **A single run per value is not a measurement of
the value** - the fifth harness error, and the one that produced the table.

**What it is.** Windows commits a thread's stack one page at a time, through
a guard page just below whatever has been touched. `main` of `matrix_main`
has a 24528-byte frame, and cxx1's prologue took it in one step -
`sub rsp, 5FD0h` - so rsp moved six pages down past the guard page, and the
first store at the bottom of the frame, `movsd [rsp], xmm0`, touched memory
the OS had never committed. That is an access violation and not a stack
overflow, because the guard page was never hit; whether it fires depends on
where the guard sat when `main` was entered, which varies run to run. The
8 MB link changed nothing because `/stack` sets the reserve, and commit is a
page at a time regardless.

**cl probes every frame of a page or more**, measured at the boundary: a
4056-byte frame is a plain `sub`, a 4120-byte one is `mov eax, N; call
__chkstk; sub rsp, rax`. Both Windows prologues - `MasmSpelling` and the GNU
`CoffSpelling` - do that now for `frameSize >= 4096`, with the unwind codes
unchanged: `UWOP_ALLOC_LARGE` still ends at the `sub`, and `__chkstk` is in
libcmt. The emit golden reports 0 of 675 files changed and 3 added - no case
in the suite had a frame that size, which is why no suite ever saw it.

**How it was found, since the first tool did not find it.** The vectored
handler from the sret investigation, linked in and run under the crash,
printed nothing. What worked is a twenty-line cl-compiled debugger -
`CreateProcess` with `DEBUG_ONLY_THIS_PROCESS`, `WaitForDebugEvent`, the
context and sixteen instruction bytes at the fault, looped until it fired.
It gave `F2 0F 11 04 24` at an address `dumpbin /disasm` put twenty-seven
bytes into `main`, right after the `sub`, with the faulting address equal to
rsp. From there the cause was one search of the prologue.

**The `.CONST`/`ALIGN` lead was not pursued**, because the fault is a store
through rsp and a misaligned `movsd` does not fault on this machine in any
case. `tests/cases/stack-probe.cpp` is the case: a 256 KB frame written from
its lowest address, which died 3 of 3 on the box before the fix and passes 3
of 3 after; `matrix_main` passes 12 of 12 where it passed 1 of 12.

**One neighbour, recorded and not taken.** `UWOP_ALLOC_LARGE` with one slot
holds size/8 in a `DW`, so a frame past 512 KB writes a value ml64 refuses
with `A2071` - loud, at the assembler, on a shape no program here has. The
two-slot form is the fix when one does.

## The four oracles, measured together at c66c8d0

**A compiler this size has four things to be checked against, and the day they
were all measured at once is worth writing down.** The suites are the fastest
and the narrowest; the real programs are the slowest and the only ones that
find what nobody thought to write a case for.

| oracle | result |
| --- | --- |
| four suites, three boxes | run 374/0, emit 675/0, names 226/0, overload 30/0, windows cases 371/0, names vs cl 161 agreed / 0 differed |
| C++ Vector Exercise | **4 of 4** - main, matrix_main, quat_main, rotrix_main, each byte-identical to clang |
| Compiler++ | **129 of 129** - its sixteen sources compiled by cxx1, linked, and the compiler they make agreeing with a clang-built one on every case in its own suite |
| the inherited C corpus | 365 ran and agreed, 58 refused, 1 wrong, of 424 - unchanged from 2026-09-02 |

**The corpus is the control and the other three are the experiment.** It is
untriaged C, it gates on nothing, and this is exactly what it is for: after
twelve commits that reordered name lookup, changed when destructors run and
added an init section to all three backends, the failing set did not move. A
change that quietly broke something old would show there first and nowhere
else.

**Compiler++ is the harder oracle and the one to keep.** 129 cases of a
compiler compiling programs is a deeper stack than any single case in
`tests/cases/`: it links sixteen objects and runs a lexer, a parser, a bytecode
pass and a code generator, comparing the output of the program *cxx1 built*
against the same program built by clang. It is what found the
base-members-built-twice bug that seven single-file probes had missed.

## Dynamic initialisation, and the four refusals that were waiting for it

**Landed 2026-09-06.** [basic.start.init]/2 runs the constructor of a
namespace-scope object before `main`, and cxx1 ran none - one missing
mechanism behind four refusals, each of which named it: a static local with
a constructor, a static data member of class type, a file-scope object with a
constructor, and a reference at file scope. All four are gone, and
`rotrix_main.cpp` of the C++ Vector Exercise - whose
`CRotrixConstants<Tag>::Identity3 = CRotrix()` is a static data member of
class type - compiles and prints byte for byte what clang prints, as the other
three programs already did.

**Three parts, and the third was not optional.** The parser synthesises one
function per file, `_GLOBAL__sub_I_<file>`, holding every construction in
declaration order; `Program::initFunction` carries its name the way `thrown`
and `rtti` carry their lists. Each backend registers it in the section its
runtime walks. And each object's destruction is registered the moment its
constructor returns - [basic.start.term], reverse order of completion -
without which every such object leaks, which `tests/cases/lifetime.h` sees.

**The registration was measured on every target before it was written**, and
the Windows half was not what it had been claimed to be:

    x86_64-linux    .section .init_array,"aw",@init_array   .quad fn
                    __cxa_atexit(&D1, &object, &__dso_handle), .hidden __dso_handle
    arm64-darwin    .section __DATA,__mod_init_func,mod_init_funcs   .quad _fn
                    ___cxa_atexit, the same three arguments
    x86_64-windows  .section .CRT$XCU,"dr",unique,0   .quad fn     (GNU syntax)
                    .CRT$XCU SEGMENT READONLY ALIGN(8) 'DATA' / DQ fn / ENDS  (MASM)
                    atexit(&??__F<name>@@YAXXZ), a helper per object that calls
                    the destructor - not __cxa_atexit, which that CRT does not have

cl's own listing writes `CRT$XCU SEGMENT` and `DQ FLAT:`, neither of which
ml64 takes - the fourth time its listing has shown what cl means rather than
what assembles, after `.pdata`, `.text$x` and `FLAT:`. The spelling above was
run on the box through `tools/windows/asm-run.cmd` before anything depended on
it: `init` printed before `main`.

**The helper's name was measured too**, because it is a symbol another object
could see: `??__Fg1@@YAXXZ` for a plain global, `??__Fmg@M@N@@YAXXZ` for one
in `N::M`, `??__F?member@H@@2US@@A@@YAXXZ` for a static member - the object's
whole symbol as one component - and `??__Floc@?1??f@@YAHXZ@YAXXZ` for a static
local. `atexitHelperName` builds all four from one rule.

**The construction is the local path's construction, into a different
object.** `readConstructorInitialiser` is the initialiser reading factored
out of `declarationBody` - `(args)`, `= expr`, `{}`, `= {}`, a braced list for
an `initializer_list` constructor, the conversion-function step, the
`explicit` and deleted-copy checks - and `constructObject` is `constructLocal`
told which object to build, a frame slot or a symbol. So a static local, a
file-scope object and a static member take exactly the forms a local takes and
are refused exactly the forms it refuses. What a file-scope object does not
get is copy elision: `S g = S(2);` builds the temporary and copies, which
C++11 permits, and a case that counts constructions must not include it.

**The init function is entered the way every other re-entry door is.**
`enterInitFunction` captures the whole `FunctionState`, clears it, and puts
the init function's frame in its place; `leaveInitFunction` takes the frame
back out, moves the guard slots made inside - not part of the state struct -
and restores the token index the restore would otherwise rewind. Every
construction at file scope, and every reference bound there, happens inside
that pair, so a temporary in an initialiser gets a slot of the right frame
and is destroyed at the end of its full expression.

**`S g(1);` at file scope was a prototype until this.** A name followed by
`(` at file scope went to the function branch before anything asked what the
type was, so `S g1(1);` was "expected a type" at the `1`. The question is the
one the local path asks - a parameter list is empty or begins with a type -
and it had to be asked *three* ways: unqualified at file scope by that scan;
qualified, `S H::m(4)`, by whether the class declares a static data member of
that name, because a member function's parameters may be class-scope typedefs
the scan cannot see (`string substr(size_type pos, ...)` inside
`std::string` was read as a static member for ten minutes, and every program
including `<string>` stopped); and in a template's out-of-line definition,
`template <class T> S K<T>::m(4);`, by the same scan inside the pattern read,
where the class's members are not yet known.

**[stmt.dcl]/4 is the other rule, and it is not this one.** A static local
is built the first time control passes through, under the ABI's guard:
`__cxa_guard_acquire` / `__cxa_guard_release` around the constructor on the
Itanium targets, `_Init_thread_header` / `_Init_thread_footer` on Windows,
with the guard at -1 while this thread builds - both measured from clang and
cl. The Windows form skips cl's TLS epoch fast path and lets the header
answer every time, which behaves identically and is recorded in
`docs/CONFORMANCE.md`. Neither form has the landing pad that would call
`__cxa_guard_abort` or `_Init_thread_abort` if the constructor threw - the
same cleanup-region gap a `try` beside a destructible local has, recorded
there too.

**A template's static member is unordered and shared.** Every translation
unit that instantiates it defines it, so the object is weak and a weak guard
beside it keeps a second copy from building it again - `_ZGV` plus the name,
clang's own shape, on the Itanium targets; `<symbol>$guard` on Windows, where
clang and cl use a COMDAT initialiser function ml64 cannot express. Weak
writable data turned out to need two spellings the tree did not have:
`.weak_definition` in `__DATA,__data` with `.space` on Mach-O, where a
`.zerofill` cannot be weak and `.weak_def_can_be_hidden` would give each unit
its own object; and `.section .bss,"bw",discard` on COFF, where
`weakDefinition` had only ever opened `.rdata` - a guard in read-only memory
faults on its first store. Both measured from clang.

**A reference at file scope is a slot holding an address.** `&global` goes
into the image as a relocation, exactly as clang does for a constant
initialiser; anything else is bound in the init function, and a temporary is
refused by name because it would need static storage of its own. Reading one
had never been exercised - `globalRef` handed back the reference type unlowered
and `f() + ref` was "cannot be combined" - and neither had naming one on the
Microsoft ABI: `?r@@3AEAHEA`, `?cr@@3AEBHEB`, `?sr@@3AEAUS@@EA`, the pointer's
rule with the E and the referent's const repeated, which `dataType` now
follows for a reference too.

**The ledger case had to register its own report first.** A destructor
registered before `main` runs *after* an `atexit` handler registered in
`main`, the two being one list read backwards, so `lfWatch()` as the first
statement of `main` would report every static object still alive. The
watcher is the first object in the file and registers the report from its
constructor; that is [basic.start.term]/3 doing what it says, and clang prints
the same line. `dynamic-init.cpp` is that case, `static-local-constructor.cpp`
the block-scope one, `dynamic-init-reference.cpp` both kinds of reference,
`template-static-data-member-ctor.cpp` the unblocked shape, and
`global-constructor.cpp` the file-scope refusal turned round. All five print
what clang prints on the Mac and on the Windows box, MASM assembled and run
there through `asm-run.cmd`.

**Found beside it and left alone: a statement that begins with a template-id
is read as a declaration.** `Consts<Tag1>::Named.v = 1;` fails where
`CNeeds<(N==3)>::check();` works, because only a `(` after the member was
taught to `atDeclarationStart`. The case reaches the member through a
reference instead and says so.

**What is still refused, by name:** an array with static storage duration
whose elements have a constructor - at file scope, as a static local, as a
static member - since each element would need its own registration and the
destructor walk knows one object per entry; and a static-duration reference
bound to a temporary.

## Class-typed exceptions: seven refusals, one of them stale

**Scoped 2026-09-06, by measurement rather than from this file.** Two programs
in `~/Documents/Claude/lambdaTest` - `catcher1.cpp` and `catcher2.cpp` - are
what asked the question. clang builds both; cxx1 stops at the first line of
each, `#include <stdexcept>`. What is behind that line is not one gap but
seven, and they are worth separating because **they do not depend on each other
and one of them is already done**.

**The refusals, each measured with a program of its own** - the earlier probes
had them masking each other, which is how the nested `try` hid the rethrow and
the rethrow hid the catch clause:

`catch (...)` compiles today, and so does the whole of rung 6 for a fundamental
type: `throw 3; catch (int e)` runs on all three targets.

**Catching by reference was the widest of the seven and the least visible from
here**, because it is not about classes at all - `catch (const int &)` was
refused by the same line. Every real C++ program catches by `const &`
([except.throw] makes catching a class by *value* a copy, and a base-class
catch of a derived object by value slices), so this one gate stops the ordinary
spelling of the feature even for the types cxx1 can already throw. It is
refused in the catch clause's declarator, one file, and it does not touch the
tables.

### The stale refusal, and why the remaining work is smaller than this file says

**Rung 6.2's text - "for a class or a pointer the compiler has to emit the
object, and that is refused by name" - was true when it was written and is now
half wrong.** `dynamic_cast` needed a `type_info` beside each vtable and got
one; `ParserClass.cpp:773` says so where it fills the slot that used to hold a
plain zero. Measured on one file declaring a polymorphic class and a plain one:

```
struct Poly { virtual ~Poly() {} int v; ... };   ->  _ZTI4Poly, _ZTS4Poly emitted
struct Plain { int v; ... };                     ->  nothing
```

So for a **polymorphic** class the object `__cxa_throw` wants is already in the
object file, with the base chain in it that a catch-by-base has to walk - and
`throw p;` is refused anyway, because `itaniumTypeInfoName` (`Mangle.cpp:1208`)
turns away every type that is not fundamental, without asking whether one was
emitted. The reason string it prints - "would have to be emitted here, and that
is its own step" - is the part that is stale.

**That splits the throw side in two, and only the second half is a step.** A
polymorphic class wants the refusal lifted and the existing symbol named. A
non-polymorphic one - which is what `catcher1.cpp` throws, and what
`std::runtime_error`'s own hierarchy is not - wants a `type_info` emitted for a
class that has no vtable to hang it off, which is where `_ZTI` and `_ZTS` have
to be emitted on demand from the throw or the catch that names them. The
Microsoft side is the four-object ThrowInfo chain rung 6.5a already writes for
a fundamental type, pointed at a class descriptor instead.

### What unblocks what

**`<stdexcept>` is last, not first.** It is a header of small classes deriving
from one another, so writing it before class throws work would produce a header
nothing can use. What it needs underneath it is the throw side, the catch side
including by-reference, and a base-class catch - and its classes hold a
`std::string`, which means the destructible-local-and-`try` limit is on its
path too rather than beside it.

**The three try/catch limits are one subject and are already named as
rung 6's own remainder** - a destructible local beside a `try`, a nested `try`,
and `return` inside a `catch` on Windows. Every one of them is about the
call-site table's ranges rather than about types, so they are independent of
everything above and would be lifted together. `catcher2.cpp` needs the first
two; `catcher1.cpp` needs the first.

**In dependency order, then:** catch by reference (one declarator, no tables);
throw and catch of a polymorphic class (lift a refusal, name a symbol that
exists); `type_info` on demand for a non-polymorphic class (the real emission
step, both ABIs); rethrow; the three try/catch limits; `<stdexcept>` on top of
all of it. Nothing here is on the ladder, and the two programs that asked for
it need every one.

## A local beside a `try`, and the sort that broke unwinding

**Rung 6.4 refused a destructible local and a `try` in one function** because
"each is a range in the call-site table and one would have to split the other".
Splitting is what happens now, for the half where the two sit side by side: the
block records which of its own statements are `try`s, its cleanup region is
emitted in the pieces between them, and the `try`'s pad destroys what it found
alive when nothing matched. That last part needs a **trailing filter-0 action
record** - phase 2 installs a pad only where the chain offers something, so
without it the destructors would never run.

**What is still refused is the overlapping half**: an object *inside* a `try`'s
body or a handler's, and a temporary in a thrown expression. There the region
sits inside the row rather than beside it.

### The sort, which looked right and was not

Relaxing the refusal made an object in a *handler* compile and catch nothing,
because the table's rows are written in the order the regions closed and a
handler's region closes after the `try` whose row begins earlier. Sorting the
rows by where each range begins fixed that case, changed **14 emitted files**,
and broke something the suite could not see.

**Nested cleanup regions are listed innermost first on purpose.** The
personality routine scans linearly and takes the *first* row whose range
contains the address, so an inner region must come before the outer one that
contains it. Sorting by address reversed exactly that, and unwinding through a
nested scope then found the outer row and ran only its destructors:

```cpp
A outer("outer");
{ A inner("inner"); boom(); }      // clang: ~inner ~outer      cxx1: ~outer
```

That is ordinary C++ - a nested block with a local, and an exception passing
through - and it is a silent leak, not a diagnostic. **It was found by checking
the 14 changed emissions rather than by the suites**, all four of which stayed
green either way; `git stash` and a rebuild is what proved the regression was
mine rather than pre-existing. The sort is reverted and the comment where it
was says why, because it is the obvious thing to try next.

**So the handler case is refused again**, by a flag of its own rather than by
the function-wide `functionHasTry_` that used to answer for all three shapes.
That flag was over-broad: a block elsewhere in the function is disjoint from
the `try` and never needed refusing at all, which is what let the local beside
it land.

### And a leak I introduced and then refused

With the region split, `try { throw S(1).v; }` compiled and lost the
temporary's destructor - clang prints `~S` before the handler and cxx1 printed
nothing. The temporary is registered on the enclosing block's list, and that
block's region is now split *around* this statement, so nothing destroyed it.
Refused by name rather than left to leak. **At HEAD it had been refused**, so
this was mine; the check is `pendingTemps_` rather than `statementTemps_`,
which is where a thrown expression's temporaries actually go and cost a wrong
first guard.

## Class-typed exceptions, three of the seven

**Landed 2026-09-06 on the two Itanium targets**, and what made them cheap is
that the object they need was already being emitted. `emitClassTypeInfo` builds
`_ZTS` and `_ZTI` for any class this compiler can describe and **needs no
vtable** - so a plain class is exactly as throwable as a polymorphic one, and
the scoping's split between "lift a refusal" and "the real emission step" was
one step after all. `itaniumTypeInfoName` refuses every non-fundamental type
without asking whether an object exists, and `typeInfoSymbolFor` is the one
helper the throw and both catch paths now share.

**Catching by a base works because the object says so, not because the
compiler does.** `__si_class_type_info` carries the base's own `_ZTI` as a
third word and the runtime walks it - the same chain a `dynamic_cast` reads -
so nothing here compares types. Measured against clang: by base, by value,
past a handler that does not match, and `catch (...)`, all agreeing.

**A rethrow is `__cxa_rethrow()` and nothing else.** The runtime knows which
exception the handler holds, so there is nothing to name and nothing to
allocate.

**And the first version of it refused a conforming program.** `throw;` with
nothing being handled looks ill-formed and is not: [except.throw]/8 makes it
well-formed and terminating, clang compiles it, and `__cxa_rethrow` calls
`std::terminate` by itself - which is the standard's answer arriving for free.
The check, and the `inHandler_` flag written to support it, were both taken
back out. **A refusal that is stricter than the standard is the same defect as
one that names the wrong version**, and it is easier to write.

### What is still refused, and one of them is not a refusal at all

`throw-refused.cpp` used to say "a fundamental type and nothing else", which
was true when written. What is left is a **pointer**, which wants
`__pointer_type_info` - a third shape carrying the pointee's object and its
qualifiers - and a class with **more than one base**, which wants
`__vmi_class_type_info`, the same shape `dynamic_cast` already refuses. Both
still refuse on all three targets and each has a case.

**`tools/exclusions` cannot derive any of it**, and that is worth knowing about
the tool rather than about the gap: the message is
`"'throw' cannot name the type of this: " + why`, and the word that marks a
refusal arrives at run time inside `why`. Three exclusions are written out in
`docs/EXCLUSIONS.md` by hand for that reason, pointing at their cases rather
than at a line.

**And the names suite found a gap that is not about names.** clang emits
`__cxa_free_exception` where cxx1 does not: it is the other half of
`__cxa_allocate_exception`, freeing the memory if the copy that stores the
thrown value into it throws. cxx1 emits allocate, store, throw with nothing
around the store, so an exception raised by that copy leaks the allocation.
Recorded in `throw-class.nonames` rather than papered over - it wants a cleanup
region over the window between the allocate and the throw, which is the same
machinery the destructible-local-and-`try` limit is waiting on.

**The case defines its constructors out of line**, which is about the suite
rather than the feature: written inside the class they are inline, clang then
emits only C2 on x86_64-linux where cxx1 emits C1 and C2, and the names suite
would report a difference about *emission* as though it were about mangling.
That is the fourth time this file has had to say so.

### Where the seven stand

| | |
| --- | --- |
| catch by reference | **done**, both ABIs |
| throw and catch a class | **done** on Itanium; Microsoft refuses by name |
| `type_info` for a non-polymorphic class | **done** - it was the same step |
| rethrow | **done** on Itanium; Microsoft refuses by name |
| a destructible local beside a `try` | open, and it blocks the rest |
| a nested `try` | open |
| `<stdexcept>` | open, and last |

**The remaining three are one subject.** A cleanup region and a `try` are both
ranges in the call-site table, and the table holds sorted disjoint ranges - so
a `try` inside a cleanup region has to split it, and a call inside the `try`
needs an action chain that offers the handlers first and the cleanup after.
That is action records in the LSDA, which is not written. `<stdexcept>`'s
classes hold a `std::string`, so the destructible-local limit is on its path
rather than beside it, and the two programs that asked for all this -
`catcher1.cpp` and `catcher2.cpp` in `~/Documents/Claude/lambdaTest` - still
stop at their first line.

## A refusal is not a substitution failure

**Every diagnostic raised inside a `Trial` is thrown rather than printed** -
that is what makes SFINAE work here, and it is written down as the one place in
this compiler where a failure recovers. What was not written down is that it
recovers from *refusals* too. A feature this compiler has not built would raise
"is not supported yet" inside a candidate's instantiation, the catch would drop
that candidate, and the reader was told nothing about it.

**The visible edge was a sentence that ended on "and".** `template <class A>
auto f(A a) -> A;` called as `f(0)` answered

    'f' is a function template and

because the fallback re-runs deduction to say why it failed - and deduction had
**succeeded**, so `why` was empty. The message is
`"'" + name + "' is a function template and " + why`, and nothing guarded the
empty case.

**The real reason was three layers down and had nothing to do with deduction.**
Instrumenting the catch printed it: `'f<int>#int' cannot be given a name the
linker can hold: this type has no Itanium linkage name yet` - the *mangler*,
refusing a deduced return type. So the candidate was dropped for a limitation
of the compiler, the call then had no overloads, and the diagnostic invented a
deduction failure that had not happened.

**[temp.deduct]/8 is about types and expressions that are ill-formed, not about
what an implementation has got round to.** The two template-instantiation sites
re-raise now when the failure was a refusal; the third `Trial` - the C-style
cast disambiguation in `(T(x) == T(y))` - keeps recovering from everything,
because there the question is syntactic and falling back to an expression is
the right answer.

**Which failures count is the rule `tools/exclusions` already uses**, bare
"yet" included. That was the second attempt: the conservative version -
"not supported", "not implemented", "is C++1" - missed this very case, whose
message says only "yet". The tool notes that bare "yet" over-matches ordinary
diagnostics and that it can afford to; here the cost of over-matching is a
hard error where a candidate should have been dropped, so it was measured
rather than argued: `overload.sh` 30/0, `template-sfinae.cpp` still printing
what it printed, and the emit golden **0 of 675 files changed**.

**What this does not do is implement anything.** `f` still cannot be compiled;
the difference is that the reader is told which limitation stopped it instead
of being handed a sentence with nothing after "and".

### And the sweep that found it was the widened one

The first grid was 46 C++11 features. The second added 59 - the preprocessor,
deeper templates, and the C++98 core a real program leans on - and found seven
more invisible gaps, **two of them C++98**: an anonymous union and a function
try block. The others are `S{0,0}` as an expression, an enumerator of a class
template, a captureless lambda converting to a function pointer, and a
range-for over a braced list. One probe was the sweep's own fault rather than
the compiler's: `0x1p0` is a C++17 hex float and clang refuses it under C++11
too, which is what validating every probe against the oracle is for.

**All six were closed, and one of them was not a refusal.** Both grids now read
63 compiling, 41 refused by name and **none invisible**, over 104 probes.

**The enumerator was a two-line fix wearing a gap's clothes.** It looked like
an anonymous-enum problem and was not: `S<int>::N` failed for a *named* enum
too, while a plain class answered fine. The branch that resolves a member
through a template-id qualifier asked for a static member function, then a
static data member, and never for an enumerator - and `enumInClass` is exactly
that lookup, sitting one line away. So the probe that looked like the smallest
of the seven was the only one with a real feature behind it, and the message it
had been giving - "has no static member 'N'" - was true and useless.

**The other five are refusals, and two of them are C++98.** An anonymous union,
whose members would have to become members of the class around it and share its
storage; and a function try block, whose handler covers the mem-initialisers as
well as the body - which is the whole reason the construct exists, and what a
`try` written inside the body cannot do. Neither is on the ladder, neither was
listed, and the C++11 grid had no reason to ask about either.

## A C++11 feature refused as C++14, and the sweep that found it

**A refusal that names the wrong standard is worse than one that names
nothing.** `template <class T> using Ptr = T*;` is an **alias template** and is
C++11 - [temp.alias] - and cxx1 answered "a variable template is C++14, and
this compiler is C++11". That message has exactly the shape this tree treats as
trustworthy: it names a feature and cites a standard version. It was wrong, and
a reader following it would have rewritten conforming C++11 for no reason.

**The cause is the token scan that recognises a variable template**, which
tells the C++14 form from the two C++11 declarations by looking for a `(` or a
class key before any `=`. `using Ptr = T*` has an `=` and neither, so it
matched. The discriminator it was missing is the keyword: **an alias template
writes `using` immediately after the parameter list and nothing else does**, so
that question is asked before the scan. `alias-template-refused.cpp` and
`variable-template-refused.cpp` are a pair on purpose - both begin
`template <...>` and both reach an `=`, and the pair is what stops one message
from claiming the other's ground.

### The sweep, and what it is for

**Found by a feature sweep rather than by a case**, and the distinction is the
point: a case tests what somebody thought to write down. The sweep is one
minimal program per C++11 feature, each checked against
`clang++ -std=c++11 -pedantic-errors` so that it is known to be conforming, and
then classified by **how cxx1 answers** - not whether it compiles:

| | 46 probes, all valid C++11 |
| --- | --- |
| compiles | 19 |
| refused **by name** | 10 |
| refused by a message naming no feature | **17** |

The seventeen were invisible: `tools/exclusions` derives its list from refusals
that say "is not supported yet" or name a standard, so none of them was in
`docs/EXCLUSIONS.md` and none could be. They collapsed to nine roots -
`= default` / `= delete`; the enum-base syntax and `enum class`; `override`,
`final` and a ref-qualifier; the alias declarations; the `R"()"` and `u8""`
literal prefixes; a `constexpr` constructor; `sizeof(S::m)`; `inline
namespace`; and `extern template`.

**All nine were given named refusals**, and the sweep now reads 19 compiling,
27 refused by name and **none invisible**. That implemented nothing: each is a
message where a parse error used to be, and the emit golden reports **0 of 675
files changed**, so no program that compiled before is affected. What it bought
is that twelve new sites are citable, `docs/EXCLUSIONS.md` runs to **115**, and
`tools/exclusions --check` reads 0 uncited and 0 stale - the gaps are now
things a reader can find rather than things a reader discovers.

**This is the pure-virtual defect again, one level up.** That one was missing
and unlisted *because* its refusal was a bare `expected ';'`, which is why the
rule here is that a refusal names the feature. Four green suites on three
machines and 377 cases had surfaced none of the seventeen, because every one of
them tests a program somebody already knew to write.

**Two of the ten "by name" refusals are the wrong kind of right.** `inline
namespace` and `extern template` reach the *implemented, but not where a type
was wanted* list, which was added so `template` would stop being called
unsupported. Both features genuinely are unimplemented in the position the
probe writes them, so the message implies they exist and the reader has merely
misplaced them. That list wants a third state.

### What the nine cost, and the three that were not where they looked

**Two doors, one helper, twice.** `= default` and `= delete` sit exactly where
`= 0` does - but a constructor reaches that position through
`declareConstructor` and a member function through the declarator tail, so the
refusal written at one door left the other saying `expected ';'`. The same
shape for an alias declaration, which has *three* doors: file scope, a block
and a class body, each with a using-declaration refusal that must not answer
for it. Both are one function called from every door rather than a copy at
each, which is this file's own rule about an invariant a person has to
remember.

**`final` is two features sharing a word.** On a member function it is a check
on the slot search; on a class head it forbids deriving. The probe wrote both
and only the class one fired, because it comes first - so a refusal written for
the function alone would have looked complete and covered half the syntax.
Neither is a keyword: `int final = 3;` still compiles, which is what a
contextual keyword means and what a case now holds.

**And `L` is not a missing prefix.** The literal-prefix refusal was written for
the whole set and `L"ab"` kept compiling - a wide literal is read further up
and works. Listing it would have been dead code implying a refusal that never
fires, which is the same defect as a message naming the wrong standard, one
size down. It is off the list and the comment says why.

### And the document had two citations swapped

`docs/EXCLUSIONS.md` cited the variable-template line for **explicit
instantiation** and the explicit-instantiation line for **a variable
template** - each row pointing at the other's refusal. `tools/exclusions`
cannot see it, because both are real refusal sites and the check asks whether a
cited line refuses, not whether it refuses *that*. Found by reading the two
messages while remapping around this fix, and it is the limit of what that
oracle can prove: it keeps the citations live, and only a reader keeps them
about the right thing.

## Catching by reference, which is a slot and not a copy

**Landed 2026-09-06, the first of the seven** - it was the widest of them and
the cheapest, being a catch-clause declarator and no table. `catch (const int
&)` had been refused by the same line as `catch (const E &)`, so the gate shut
the ordinary spelling of the feature even for the types cxx1 could already
throw.

**A reference holds what `__cxa_begin_catch` handed back.** That call returns
the address of the exception object, which is the thing the reference is *to* -
so the slot takes the pointer and every mention of the name dereferences it, as
any reference here does. A by-value handler casts, dereferences and copies; a
by-reference one casts and stores. Measured before it was written, and clang's
shape is the same one:

    clang    callq __cxa_begin_catch ; movq %rax, -32(%rbp) ; movl (%rax), %esi
    cxx1     call  __cxa_begin_catch ; movq %rax, (%rdi)    ; movq (%rax), %rax

**The type_info names the referent, not the reference** - [except.handle]/3
makes a handler of type `cv T &` match exactly what `T` matches - so
`catch (const int &)` and `catch (int)` both write `_ZTIi`, and a class caught
by reference will name the class. That is one line, and getting it wrong would
have produced a handler the runtime never selects rather than a diagnostic.

**Microsoft says it in the handler map's adjectives word**, and the bit was
measured rather than reasoned about: 0 for a by-value handler and **8** for a
reference, both naming the same descriptor. `MsHandler::byReference` carries it
from the parser to `Masm.cpp`, through `MsHandlerRow`, beside the 0x40 that
already marked a catch-all.

    by value       .long 0   # Adjectives    ??_R0H@8    CatchObjOffset 60
    by reference   .long 8   # Adjectives    ??_R0H@8    CatchObjOffset 56

**`catch (T &&)` is refused by name and is not an exclusion.**
[except.handle]/1 forbids it: the exception object belongs to the runtime and
outlives the handler, so there is nothing here to take apart. clang refuses the
same program, which is why the refusal says so plainly rather than "is not
supported yet" - and why `tools/exclusions` counts 102 sites where it counted
103, one genuinely removed and the new one correctly not added. Same rule as
`static double S::x`: code C++11 itself forbids belongs in neither document.

**The emit golden reports 0 of 675 files changed**, 6 added - nothing that
already compiled emits differently, and the six are the two new cases across
three targets. `catch-by-reference.cpp` runs six shapes against clang: a const
reference, a non-const one written through, a reference handler chosen past
another, a `double`, an unnamed one, and a by-value handler beside them.
**No handler in it returns**, because `return` inside a `catch` is refused on
x86_64-windows - each writes a variable and the printing happens after, which
is what lets the one case prove the adjectives word on the box that owns it.

**And it needed the `.nocl` twin every throwing case needs**, which the first
three-box run is what said: cl emits the four objects a Microsoft throw is
identified by as public COMDATs and cxx1 emits them file-local, so twelve names
- four each for the `char`, the `int` and the `double` - are cl's and not
cxx1's. That is 6.5a's own measured decision, a public copy colliding with
cl's at the link, and it is one-directional: nothing cxx1 emits is missing from
cl. Recorded rather than argued with, beside
`condition-declaration-unwind.nocl`, which records the same four for one type.

**What it does not unblock is the two programs that asked for it.**
`catcher1.cpp` and `catcher2.cpp` still stop at `#include <stdexcept>`, and
`catch (const E &e)` for a class now reaches the *type_info* refusal rather
than the reference one - which is the next step in the order the scoping set,
and the sign this one landed where it was aimed.

## The object ledger, because printing cannot show a leak

**Every suite here compares what a program prints, and three failures leave
the output identical**: an object leaked, an object destroyed twice, and a
destructor run on a slot nothing constructed. That is not a gap in the corpus,
which can be widened. It is a gap in the *oracle*, and it ran the length of
this project: **Compiler++ matched a clang build on all 200 comparisons under
a compiler that leaks every data member of every class with a written
destructor**, and it matched because a leak does not reach stdout. Four suites
were green on three machines throughout.

`tests/cases/lifetime.h` is the instrument. `lfBuilt(this, "C")` at the end of
every constructor, `lfGone(this, "C")` at the start of every destructor,
`lfWatch()` as the first statement of `main`, and one line at exit:

    LEDGER built=9 gone=9 live=0 double=0 phantom=0 over=0 lost=0

**live, double, phantom, over and lost must be zero for any conforming
implementation**, whatever it chose to elide - each is an object leaked,
destroyed twice, destroyed unbuilt, built over a live one, or past the table.
`built` and `gone` are the weaker pair, because C++11 permits elision and the
two oracles take different options; a case that leaves elision any freedom
must not have its `built` count read as a fact. That is the rule
`return-copy-balance.cpp` and `move-only.cpp` already followed by hand, and
this generalises it rather than inventing it.

**A sanitizer is not the same instrument and would not have found this.** The
invariant is [basic.life]'s - one construction and one destruction per object
- not the heap's. A member destructor that never runs allocates nothing, so
there is nothing for ASan or `leaks` to report; only the program's own
bookkeeping can see it.

**Two things the ledger got wrong on its first run, both worth keeping.**

*An address does not identify an object.* A member at offset 0 shares the
address of the class holding it, and so does a base subobject - so keying a
slot by address alone made `struct D { P x; }` look like one object built
twice, and the ledger reported `over=1` on a **correct** program compiled by
clang. A slot is keyed by address *and* class name. The instrument had to be
calibrated against the oracle before it could be pointed at the compiler.

*The report has to come from `atexit`, not from the end of `main`.* An object
destroyed on the way out of `main` - including one that should never have been
destroyed - goes after `main`'s last statement and before the `atexit`
handlers, so an inline report prints too early and misses exactly the window
the phantom lives in. Measured: both compilers run `atexit` after the locals.

**What it catches, measured the day it was written.** A user-written
destructor that never destroys its member reports `gone=1 live=1` where clang
reports `gone=2 live=0`; a lambda's return-type deduction leaking `alive_`
reports `phantom=1`; a class captured by value reports one construction where
two happened. All three printed identical output before.

**Six correct lifetime shapes were put under it and five agree** - a scope,
two objects in one scope, a member reached through an *implicit* destructor, a
by-value parameter, a copy, and a temporary bound to a const reference. Those
five are `tests/cases/lifetime-ledger.cpp`. The sixth is a class whose
*written* destructor has a member or base to destroy, which cxx1 does not run;
its case belongs with the fix rather than beside the instrument.

**The rule going forward: a case about object lifetime uses the ledger.** A
case that prints constructor traces and nothing else is checking that the
right words appear in the right order, which is worth having and is not the
same as checking that the objects balance.

### And the names suite could not see a whole class of symbol

**Wiring the ledger in found a blind spot in `tools/mangled-names`, not in the
compiler.** The case has file-scope `static` counters, and the suite reported
`_ZL7counter` and `_ZL5table` as cxx1-only names. They are not: **clang
spells them identically**. What differed was the *directive* - clang defines a
zero-initialised internal object with `.comm` on ELF and `.lcomm` for the
Microsoft target, cxx1 writes a label in `.bss` or a MASM `DB n DUP (?)`, and
the scrape read labels and `DB` and neither `comm` form.

So every zero-initialised internal-linkage object in the corpus had been
**invisible on both sides** rather than agreed, and the suite said nothing
because nothing was compared. Two `-e` patterns fixed it, and the first thing
the sharper scrape did was surface a real recorded divergence on a target that
had been silently passing: `value-init-empty-braces` names a static local
differently from clang on x86_64-windows exactly as its x86_64-linux line
already recorded, and that half had never been checked.

**The lesson is the one this file already draws about the Windows runner**:
a scrape that reads one spelling will quietly check one spelling, and the
count is the only place it shows. `_ZL` is also on the scrape's exclusion
list for *labels*, which is right - an `L` label is a local temporary - and
was hiding nothing here only because the name reached the list by another
route.

## The eleven alternative tokens, which are a lexer rewrite and nothing else

`and or not xor compl bitand bitor and_eq or_eq xor_eq not_eq` are keywords in
C++ ([lex.digraph] table 2 and [lex.key] table 4), where C makes them macros in
`<iso646.h>`. They were the first item on the 2026-09-06 handover's open list,
and they came from the *user's own keyword list* rather than from either probe
grid - a third way of asking, finding what two grids of 105 probes had not.

**[lex.digraph]/2 is the whole design: each alternative token behaves in every
respect as its primary token, except for its spelling.** So the implementation
is eleven lines of table in `Lexer::alternativeToken` and a branch in the
identifier path that makes `and` a `Punct` holding `&&`. No parser rule hears
of the spelling, and that is what makes the feature reach past expressions for
free:

- `bitand` is `&`, so it is a reference declarator and an address-of as well as
  a bitwise and - `int bitand r = n;` and `int *p = bitand n;` both work, and
  neither is a case in the parser.
- `compl` is `~`, so it names a destructor. `compl S();` inside the class and
  `S::compl S() { }` out of line are both accepted, because the destructor rule
  is reading a `~` by the time it looks.
- `operator and` reaches the refusal that names `operator&&`, which is refused
  here for a reason of its own. It is named correctly, which is the point.

**Nine of the eleven were invisible before this.** `not` and `compl` can begin
an expression, so they reached the keyword door and were refused by name; the
other nine produced `expected ';'` or `expected ')'` - a message naming no
feature, which is exactly the bucket `tools/exclusions` cannot see and the
2026-09-06 sweep was built to empty. The sweep emptied both of its grids and
this was still outside them.

### The preprocessor needed the same eleven, separately

`#if 1 and 1` is a conditional-expression in the same grammar, and cxx1's `#if`
evaluator works on **text** rather than on the lexer's tokens - so it got its
own rewrite, `spellAlternativeTokens` in `src/Preprocessor.cpp`, over one table
shared with the lexer. Two things about where it runs:

- **After macro expansion, not before.** A macro *name* may not be a keyword,
  but a macro *body* may spell one: `#define AND and` then `#if 1 AND 1` is
  well-formed, and clang compiles it.
- **Word by word, and quoted spans copied.** `android` is a name and not `&&`
  followed by `roid`, and a character literal must not be rewritten into an
  operator.

Both were measured against clang before being written, and the old answer was
`this condition has something left over: 'and 1'` - which is a named-looking
message about nothing, the worst of the three kinds.

### What the change is checked by

`tests/cases/alternative-tokens.cpp` runs all eleven as operators, `bitand` as
a declarator and an address-of, `compl` as a destructor name in both places,
and four `#if` conditions. `alternative-token-not-a-name.cpp` is the other
half: `int and = 1;` is ill-formed, and cxx1 refuses it at clang's column. The
pair is deliberate - **a lexer that handed `and` on as an identifier would fail
the first case loudly and pass the second quietly**, and only one of them says
which mistake was made.

**The emit golden read `0 of 675 files changed`**, which is the claim a
front-end rewrite most needs and cannot make by counting passes: eleven words
became eleven operators and not one byte of any existing case moved.

Two shapes in the case are for `names.sh` and not for the feature, and both are
this file's standing traps met again: `S`'s constructor and destructor are
defined **out of line**, because clang emits only the C2 variant of one written
inline; and the block holding the `S` calls `printf` after it, because a scope
whose only cleanup can never be reached needs no landing pad and clang drops
the `_Unwind_Resume` cxx1 keeps. Removing either turns the case red for a
reason that is not about alternative tokens.

### And the six digraphs, the other half of that table

Done the same day, as its own step. `<% %> <: :>` are `{ } [ ]` and are four
more rows of the lexer's table; `%:` and `%:%:` are `#` and `##` and are **not
the lexer's at all** - the `#` a program can write is a preprocessing token,
and cxx1's preprocessor reads text rather than the lexer's tokens, so it got
`hashLen`, which answers with the *length* of what is there so each of the four
sites steps over the spelling it actually found rather than assuming the short
one. The sites are the directive introducer, the directive-name scan, and `#`
and `##` in a replacement list, twice - substitution and validation.

**`%:` inside a string literal is left alone for free**, because the
replacement-list scan already consumes a literal whole before it looks for a
`#`. That ordering was there for `"a#b"` and is what makes `"a#b%:c"` come out
right too.

**`<::` is the one place a digraph is not one**, [lex.pptoken]/3: `<::` with
neither `:` nor `>` after it is `<` and then `::`, which is what makes
`Box<::Tag>` a template-id rather than `Box[:Tag>`. The exception is itself
excluded when a `>` follows, so `<::>` is `[` `]`. Both spellings are in the
case on purpose - **getting either one wrong breaks the other**, and a test
with only one of them would call that a pass.

Nothing else in the six is ambiguous, and the reason is worth keeping: `%` and
`:` each need a right operand, so `%>` and `:>` can never be the end of one
expression and the start of the next. `7 % 3` and a ternary are in the case to
say so.

## An array parameter mangles as `Q` on the Microsoft ABI

Found on 2026-09-06 from the first shape of `tests/cases/digraphs.cpp`, which
declared `int sum(const int a[], int n)` before the array parameter was taken
out of it, and fixed the same day. **Measured on cl, the oracle of record, and
clang agrees:**

    int f(int a[], int n)         ?f@@YAHQEAHH@Z
    int g(int *a, int n)          ?g@@YAHPEAHH@Z
    int h(const int a[], int n)   ?h@@YAHQEBHH@Z
    int k(int *const a, int n)    ?k@@YAHQEAHH@Z

**`Q` there is "const pointer", and the rule is one rule and not two.**
[dcl.fct]/5 adjusts a parameter written as an array to a pointer and deletes its
top-level cv; the *type* is the adjusted one on both ABIs, and Itanium mangles
that - `_Z1fPii` for all four above. The Microsoft ABI mangles from **before**
the adjustment, so it keeps two facts Itanium throws away: that the parameter
was written as an array, and that it was written const. An array parameter is
spelled as the const pointer it would have been.

### Which spelling wins is the first declaration's

Measured, because it is the part a reader would guess wrong:

    int p(int a[], int n);  int p(int *a, int n) { }     ?p@@YAHQEAHH@Z
    int q(int *a, int n);   int q(int a[], int n) { }    ?q@@YAHPEAHH@Z

The definition does not get a say. cxx1 has this for nothing: a function's
symbol is computed once, in `declareFunction`, where the name is first seen, and
a redeclaration finds the existing `Signature` and returns.

### The written list cannot live on the function type

That was the first attempt and `names.sh` caught it inside a minute. **A
function type is interned on its parameters**, so `f(int a[])` and `g(int *a)`
above are *one* `Type`; hanging the written list on it gave `g` a `Q` as well,
and every plain-pointer parameter in the file with it. The record is worth
keeping because the mistake looks right: the type is where a type fact belongs,
and this is not a fact about the type.

What it is instead: `Parser::manglingType(fn)` hands the Microsoft mangler **a
function type of its own**, built from the written list and used nowhere else -
not stored on a declaration, never compared against anything, invisible to
Itanium. `parameterAsWritten` is the one rule that makes it, and the written
list travels from the parameter list to the symbol in `writtenParams_` /
`writtenFor_`, matched on the *list* rather than on arity so a stale one cannot
be picked up. Every written parameter list clears the pair before it fills it.

**Three doors, and each was found by measuring rather than by reading.** An
ordinary member goes through `memberSymbol`; a constructor calls
`microsoftConstructorName` itself from `declareConstructor`; a free function
goes through `functionSymbol`. Fixing the first left the other two writing `P`,
and the constructor was the one that looked already covered.

### What was still wrong, and got its own sweep

**`volatile` is discarded in the declarator**, so `int *volatile p` was `R` on cl
and `P` here. That was not a regression, and it could not be mended in the
mangler: cxx1 has no volatile in its type system at all. Accepted-and-ignored is
a fourth bucket beside the three the 2026-09-06 sweep sorted refusals into, and
it got the sweep it was worth on 2026-09-07 - see below.

## The volatile sweep, 2026-09-07

**A fourth bucket, and it is the one a sweep of refusals cannot see.** The
2026-09-06 sweep sorted *refusals* into three: compiles, refused by name,
refused by a message naming no feature. `volatile` was in none of them, because
cxx1 **accepts** it and throws it away - so the compiler answers, the answer is
wrong, and nothing anywhere says so. Twenty-four shapes, one minimal program
each, every one first validated by `clang++ -std=c++11 -pedantic-errors`:

| | shapes | what cxx1 did |
| --- | --- | --- |
| right | 6 | agrees with clang on all three targets |
| silently wrong name | 9 | compiles, wrong linkage name, nothing said |
| accepts the ill-formed | 5 | compiles a program clang refuses |
| refused, naming nothing | 4 | `expected ';'`, `'f' is defined twice` |

**Not one of the eighteen was visible.** That is the finding; the fixes follow
from it.

### Why an object is right and a type is not

`volatile`'s runtime guarantee is that every read is a read. **cxx1 optimises
nothing**, so every read of every object is already a load from its address and
every write a store - measured, three reads of one `volatile int` emit three
`ldr`s on arm64. The guarantee holds by construction rather than by being
implemented.

What the qualifier also is, and what cxx1 has no way to spell, is *part of a
type*. `volatile int *` is `_Z1fPVi` and `?f@@YAXPECH@Z`; a plain `int *` is
`_Z1fPi` and `?f@@YAXPEAH@Z`. So the line is drawn where the qualifier reaches a
type a linkage name is made from, and it is drawn by refusing:

- **a pointer or reference to a volatile type** - refused at the specifiers,
  looking at the token after them, which also catches `volatile int &`, `const
  volatile int *`, a `(volatile int *)` cast and a `f<volatile int *>` argument
- **`T *volatile`** - Itanium is right about it *by accident*, [dcl.fct]/5
  deleting a parameter's top-level cv; cl writes `REAH`, so it is refused
  everywhere, the accident not holding for a pointer object of its own
- **a volatile member function** - the cv on `this` is half a member function's
  identity on both ABIs
- **a typedef of a volatile type** - it would carry the qualifier past the
  refusal the written form meets, and the typedef's own `*` is a star after a
  name with nothing on it
- **a volatile object with external linkage, on x86_64-windows only** - cl
  decorates a variable's name with its cv, `?g@@3HC` where a plain int is
  `?g@@3HA`, and neither Itanium target decorates a variable at all. A genuine
  per-target refusal, with `volatile-object.notarget` naming it

Accepted, and unchanged: a volatile local, a volatile local array, a volatile
by-value parameter, an internal-linkage volatile object, a volatile data member.
The C corpus measured 365/58/1 before and after - `qs_volatile.c`,
`qs_qualifier_order.c`, `hd_setjmp.c` and `hd_standard_headers.c` all use
volatile in exactly those shapes.

### A trial was swallowing the refusals it should have reported

`(volatile int *)&v` came back `expected an expression`. The C-style cast is
parsed **tentatively** - `Trial` in `castExpr` - to tell a cast from a
parenthesised expression, and it caught every `SubstitutionFailure` and answered
"not a cast". `Source::fail` already marks a refusal that names a feature
(`unsupported`), and `ParserTemplate` already honours it in both its catches;
this one did not. **A refusal that names a feature is an answer, not a no**, and
it now propagates. That is a fix to every named refusal reachable from a cast,
not only volatile's.

### What the sweep left, all measured

- **`&v` of a volatile object gives a plain `int *`**, so `int *p = &v;` is
  accepted where clang refuses. Needs volatile in the type system; there is no
  refusal that catches it without one.
- **A non-volatile member called on a volatile object** is accepted, same
  reason.
- **A volatile return type** - `volatile int f()` is `?f@@YA?CHXZ` on cl and
  `?f@@YAHXZ` here. The token after the specifiers is the function's name, which
  is also what an object with a parenthesised initialiser looks like, so the
  refusal that catches the rest cannot tell them apart. Microsoft only.

Doing better than any of these means volatile in the type system, mirroring
`const_`: 80 `isConst()` sites, 70 `constThis`, plus `V` for Itanium and the
`C`/`D` pointee and `Q`/`R`/`S` pointer letters for Microsoft. That is a rung,
not a sweep.

## A function-local static is named `f.n`, where Itanium writes `_ZZ1fvE1n`

Found by the volatile sweep and nothing to do with volatile - `static volatile
int n` inside a function was in the first draft of `volatile-object.cpp`, and
`names.sh` went red on the wrong axis. Measured with the qualifier taken off:

    int f()          { static int n; ... }   cxx1 f.n   clang _ZZ1fvE1n
    inline int f()   { static int n; ... }   cxx1 f.n   clang _ZZ1fvE1n
    template <class T> int f() { static int n; ... }
                                             cxx1 f.n   clang _ZZ1fIiEivE1n

**For an ordinary function this is cosmetic** - the object is private to the
translation unit and nothing outside can name it either way. **For an inline
function or a function template it is a defect**: those may be defined in
several translation units and the standard says there is *one* static, which is
the whole reason Itanium mangles the name. cxx1 gives each translation unit its
own, and no one-file test suite can see it. Not fixed, and its own step.

**A template parameter as an array element is refused**: `template <class T>
int f(T a[], int n)` stops with `target: no size for this type yet`, which names
no feature. Unrelated to the mangling and unlisted, so it is in the same
invisible bucket the sweep was built to empty.

## How correctness is established

Differential testing against gcc, clang and cl over a growing corpus. That is
the method that produced Compiler-C's 418/418 and its zero disagreements
against cl, and with self-hosting off the table it is the only oracle here.

A green suite proves nothing until you prove what it ran against. Rebuild from
clean before believing a number, and record the commit it was measured at.

**Check `origin/main` before starting, not after.** This tree moves fast enough
that a clone taken days ago is a different compiler: rungs 5, 6 and most of 7
landed in the four days after rung 4, and the parser became nine files under
`src/parser/` in the middle of it. A session that began from a stale clone
re-fixed a bug `bd63799` had already fixed, wrote a second copy of
`tests/cases/virtual-inline` under another name, and produced a patch against
`src/Parser.cpp` - a path that no longer exists. None of it was detectable from
inside that clone, where the suite was green and the bug reproduced exactly as
reported. `git fetch origin main && git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main` costs a
second and answers it; run it before the first edit rather than when the patch
will not apply.

**cl on the Windows box is the primary venue for measuring the Microsoft
ABI.** clang will spell Microsoft names on any machine and stays useful for
that, but it is a second implementation of that ABI where cl is the ABI, and
the two have already been seen to differ about code generation - the secondary
vtable and the biased `this` in `tests/cases/thunk.cpp` were settled by cl and
not by clang. So a Microsoft question is asked of cl first.

    tools/cl-measure some.cpp             cl's assembly listing and symbols
    tools/cl-measure some.cpp symbols     just the symbols

cl has no C++11 mode - its floor is `/std:c++14` - so it answers about the ABI
and not about which language version a construct belongs to. That question
still goes to `clang++ -x c++ -std=c++11 -pedantic-errors`, and the two Itanium
targets have no other oracle at all.

**Its Windows half lives in `tools/windows/`, in this repository**, and that is
deliberate: scaffold kept only on the box comes back after a rebuild as what
looks like a network fault.

**The Windows runner checks the refusals too**, and did not until 2026-08-29.
It looped over `*.expected` alone - "every case that has recorded output" -
so 45 of 90 cases were checked there while the other two boxes ran all 90.
Mostly that repeated what they had already proved, since the parser is shared;
but not entirely, and the exception is the part that mattered. `throw`, `try`
and a local with a destructor are refused *only* for x86_64-windows, and
until the loop existed **no box checked those refusals at all**. It now runs
86 of 90 with four named skips - and the first thing it found was that
`throw-refused` stops for a different reason on that target, which is correct
and is why the case is skipped there rather than argued with.

The lesson is worth more than the fix: **a runner that iterates one kind of
file will quietly check one kind of thing**, and the count is the only place
it shows.

**And the same lesson one file over: 53 `.nocl` records, and no run printed
one of them.** `.notarget` reasons are printed on every run - deliberately,
because an exclusion nobody sees is an exclusion nobody removes - and `.nocl`
had drifted out of that rule without anybody deciding it should. The box wrote
a bare `.skip` marker, the Mac never saw the case, and the branch in
`verify-three` whose comment said "the reason is printed, not swallowed" was
unreachable: a `.nocl` case has no `.mine.txt` for the comparison loop to walk.

**One number was covering four different things**, which is what made it
invisible. A `.skip` is written for a `.notarget`, for a `.nocl`, for a case
cxx1 refused and for one cl refused - and three of those four are expected,
cl having no C++11 mode. The summary breaks them out now, prints each `.nocl`'s
first ninety-six characters, and **names any case cxx1 refused that no
exclusion file covers**, which was the one genuinely silent kind: a case that
stops compiling leaves the comparison and the agreed count simply falls.

A reason is joined onto one line before it is cut, because a `.nocl` may be
wrapped - `head -1` of a wrapped one is a fragment ending mid-sentence.

**Do not edit a shell script while a run of it is in flight.** `sh` seeks
through the file as it executes, so an edit ahead of the point it has reached
changes what it will parse. This edit landed under a `tools/verify-three
windows` that was still running on the box; the run was killed and restarted
rather than believed.

**And the tar excludes iCloud's duplicates now, rather than a sweep hoping to
have caught them.** iCloud Drive copies a file it is syncing to `name 2.ext`
whenever it likes - including *between* a sweep and the tar a second later. A
shipped `tests/cases/foo 2.cpp` is a case whose `.expected` does not carry its
name, so the far side reports `foo 2: did not run` and the leg goes red saying
nothing whatever about the compiler. One three-box round was spent on exactly
that, on two case files created ten minutes earlier. `--exclude '* [0-9]'` and
`--exclude '* [0-9].*'` are the fix; no file in this tree has a space in its
name, so they cost nothing. The Makefiles already guard the same trap with a
`$(wildcard)` filter, and this is that guard at the other end of the wire.

## `dynamic_cast<void *>`, and two ABIs answering differently

**Landed 2026-09-07.** [expr.dynamic.cast]/7 - a pointer to the *most derived*
object - was the last shape of `dynamic_cast` that could be built, and it names
no target class, so it asks the object without asking the type graph: no second
`_ZTI` is handed over and no base chain is walked. The answer is a number the
object already carries.

### It was invisible, and that is the point worth keeping

It was refused by **"'dynamic_cast' casts to a pointer to a class, and 'void *'
is not one"** - a message that names no feature and never says "not supported
yet". So `tools/exclusions` could not list it, `docs/EXCLUSIONS.md` never
carried it, and nothing in this file said it was missing. That is exactly the
third bucket of the 2026-09-06 sweep, still producing a month's work later: a
refusal that reads like a **type error** about the program rather than a gap in
the compiler. The sweep's lesson is not that the list is now complete. It is
that this bucket is where the next gap will be.

### The two ABIs do not do the same thing, and neither was guessed

**Itanium generates it inline.** Measured from clang at -O0 on arm64-darwin:

    ldr  x9, [x8]          ; the vptr, at the front of the object
    ldur x9, [x9, #-16]    ; offset-to-top, two words before the address point
    add  x8, x8, x9        ; and that is the complete object

Offset-to-top is signed and sits at the address point minus two words, with the
`_ZTI` between it and the first entry. It is zero for the most derived class
itself, so one expression is right for a pointer that is already the whole
object and for one pointing into a base.

**Microsoft has no offset-to-top at all**, so this is a different answer rather
than the same one spelled differently. The complete object is reached through
the Complete Object Locator in front of the vftable, whose `offset` dword at +4
holds the subobject's position - and MSVC does not read it inline, it calls
`__RTCastToVoid(p)`: **one argument**, where `__RTDynamicCast` beside it takes
five. cxx1 emits the call.

**The Microsoft half was written from clang and confirmed by cl the same day**,
once the box came back. `clang++ --target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -O0` emits
`callq __RTCastToVoid` and, in LLVM IR, `declare ptr @__RTCastToVoid(ptr)`;
cl, asked afterwards, emits

    mov  rcx, QWORD PTR p$[rsp]
    call __RTCastToVoid

and nothing else, against the five arguments it passes `__RTDynamicCast` for a
`dynamic_cast<D *>` in the same file. Same undecorated symbol, same single
argument, and `dynamic_cast<const void *>` is the identical call. What cxx1
already emits is enough for it - the runtime reads the locator pointer at
`vftable[-1]` and the `offset` dword, both of which `Masm.cpp` lays down for
every polymorphic class.

**Ask cl with `/GR`, not through `tools/windows/measure.cmd`.** That script
passes `/GR-` on purpose, because it exists for mangling questions and RTTI
objects are noise in a name listing - but `/GR-` suppresses exactly what a
`dynamic_cast` question is about. A second script beside it, taking the same
single unquoted argument, is what asked this one.

**cl emits no null test**, relying on the runtime to answer null for null. The
guard cxx1 emits is kept anyway: it costs one compare, and dropping it would
trade a measured fact for an assumption about a CRT this tree does not ship.

**The null test is not an optimisation.** On Itanium the load goes *through*
the pointer, so a null operand would fault where [expr.dynamic.cast]/2 says the
answer is null. clang emits the same branch for the same reason. The Microsoft
path keeps the guard too, although the runtime is documented to answer null for
null - that half is the part clang could not tell us.

### A raw `Binary` on a pointer adds bytes

`pointerAdd` is what scales by the pointee's size; a `Binary(BinOp::Add, p, n)`
built directly does not. The virtual-call lowering already relied on that -
it multiplies the slot index by the pointer size itself - and this reads the
same way. Written down because the two spellings look identical at the call
site and differ by a factor of eight.

### What the symbol listing caught that the running program could not

`names.sh` reported a difference the `.expected` never could: for a two-base
class, clang emits `_ZTI4Both` and `_ZTS4Both`, and **cxx1 emits neither** -
its vtable carries a plain zero in the type_info slot:

    cxx1                  clang
    .quad 0               .quad 0
    .quad 0               .quad __ZTI4Both
    .quad ...D1Ev         .quad ...D1Ev
    .quad ...D0Ev         .quad ...D0Ev
    .quad -16             .quad -16
    .quad 0               .quad __ZTI4Both

That is the existing `__vmi_class_type_info` refusal showing through rather
than new damage, and the case is still right **because the two slots are not
the same slot**: this cast reads offset-to-top, where cxx1 writes `0` and `-16`
exactly as clang does, and never touches the null one. A `dynamic_cast<Both *>`
would need the null one and is refused by name before it can look. Recorded in
`dynamic-cast-void-multiple.nonames`.

### The other shape is blocked, and not by effort

`dynamic_cast<T &>` has no null to answer with, so a failure throws
`std::bad_cast` - a **polymorphic** class. Measured the same day: throwing a
polymorphic class is refused on *every* target, and Windows refuses a class
throw at all. So the reference form sits behind the same class-exception work
`catcher1.cpp` and `catcher2.cpp` are behind, and its refusal already says so.

### Two cases, and why they are two

`dynamic-cast-void.cpp` runs on **all three** targets - a downcast source, two
levels of derivation, a most-derived pointer, a `const` one and a null.
`dynamic-cast-void-multiple.cpp` holds the shape the feature exists for, a
`Second *` into a `Both` whose offset-to-top is **negative** - and it is a
separate file because the Microsoft ABI refuses that layout for a reason older
than this feature. Kept in one file, the whole feature would have been skipped
on Windows and the `__RTCastToVoid` path would never have been compiled by the
suite that was supposed to check it.

## Range-based `for` over a class

**Landed 2026-09-07**, and it is the last thing between cxx1 and the ordinary
spelling of a loop over a container. [stmt.ranged] defines the statement *by
rewriting it*, and the parser does that rewrite:

    auto &&__range = expr;
    for (auto __b = __range.begin(), __e = __range.end(); __b != __e; ++__b)
        { T x = *__b; body }

### The reference is a pointer, and that is the whole design

cxx1 cannot declare `auto &&__r`, so `__r` is an `R *` holding `&expr` and every
use is `*__r`. **That is the same object, evaluated once** - which is not a
detail: a copy of the range would give a loop that walks a snapshot, and an
expression with a side effect would run twice. `range-for-class.cpp` proves it
with a `counted()` returning a reference and printing `evaluations 1`.

**The consequence is that a temporary range is refused.** `auto &&__range`
extends the lifetime of what `f()` returned to the end of the loop; a pointer
does not, and walking a dead object is worse than refusing. clang compiles that
program and is right to. The refusal names the remedy, which costs one line:
name the range, then loop over the name.

### Members first, and the fallback refused by name

[stmt.ranged]/1 looks `begin` and `end` up **as members** and only if neither is
found looks for free `begin(r)` and `end(r)` by argument-dependent lookup. The
member half is built, through `memberCallWith` - the same path an ordinary
`v.begin()` takes - so overload resolution, access control and the const/
non-const pair come with it rather than being re-implemented. A class with
neither is refused by a message that says the fallback is what is missing.

### The iterator must be a pointer, and every one in `include/` is

`vector<T>::iterator` is `T *` here, which is the simplification that header
made on purpose, and `string`, `set` and `map` follow it. So the loop cxx1
builds is the pointer loop: `__b != __e` is a pointer comparison, `++__b` is
pointer arithmetic and `*__b` is a load. **A class iterator is refused by name**,
and the message lists the three operators the next step has to resolve -
`operator!=`, `operator++` and `operator*`, each of which this compiler has and
none of which this loop has been measured against.

### The two paths share every line after the two ends

The branch computes `begin-expr` and `end-expr` and nothing else; the condition,
the step, the loop variable and the body are one piece of code for an array and
a class alike. That was deliberate - **written twice, a change to one copy would
be a divergence no case could see**, which this file records happening
elsewhere. What proves the refactor cost the array path nothing is the emit
golden: **0 of 675 files changed**, so every array loop in the suite emits the
byte it emitted before.

### A case was overwritten, and the name change is the record

`range-for-class.cpp` already existed, from 2026-08-29, holding the refusal this
round lifts - a class with `begin()` and `end()` returning `int *`, refused by
name. It was **overwritten by accident** while writing the new case, and its
orphaned `.error` is what turned `run.sh` red. Deleting it is right, and is the
standing rule that a landed feature deletes its refusal in the same commit; the
route there was a clobbered file rather than a decision, which is worth knowing
because nothing in the suites would have said so if the `.error` had gone with
it. **Check that a case name is free before writing one.**

### What it unblocked

`~/Documents/Claude/lambdaTest/lambda.cpp` compiles unmodified and prints what
clang prints. That file is four lines - a `std::vector<int>` from a braced list,
`std::sort` with a lambda comparator, and a range-based `for` over the result -
and the range-for was the only thing in it cxx1 could not do. Measured against
clang: `vector`, `string`, `set`, `map`, `auto`, an empty range, a const
container, nested loops and a user-written class, nine shapes, all agreeing.

## One type, one selector index - and the miscompile beside it

**Landed 2026-09-07**, as the prerequisite for a destructible object inside a
`try` body, and worth its own section because what it repaired was a coupling
nobody had written down.

### The parser predicts a number the backend writes

A selector is an index into the function's type table. **The backend writes it
into the action record and the parser has already written `sel == n` into the
handler chain** - `Walker::lsdaTable` numbering by position in `types`, and
`ParserStmt.cpp` numbering with a counter of its own. Two independent
implementations of one numbering, agreeing by convention and checked by
nothing.

They agreed because the backend *appended* per row and no two rows had ever
shared a type. The moment one did, they would not - and the shape that shares
one is exactly what a destructible object inside a `try` body needs, since its
cleanup rows must carry the enclosing `try`'s catch types to be found in
phase 1 at all.

**Deduplicating only the backend is a hang, not a wrong answer.** Measured:
two `try`s catching `int` in one function, with the backend sharing the entry
and the parser still counting 1, 2 - the second handler compares against a
number the runtime never returns, falls through to `_Unwind_Resume`, and the
pad resumes into itself. `emit.sh` reported ten changed files and four suites
stayed green either way; the program looped forever.

So both sides deduplicate now, first occurrence winning, 1-based, and
`Parser::typeIndexFor` says in a comment that it must match `lsdaTable` byte
for byte. `catch (...)` is the empty string and is shared like any other -
clang emits one `.long 0` for two catch-alls in a function, and nothing ever
compares against its selector.

**Ten emissions changed and every one was read.** Five cases across both
Itanium targets, each the selector immediate and the action-record byte moving
together with surplus `_ZTI` entries leaving the table.
`catch-by-reference.cpp` is the legible one: seven handlers,
`int int double char double int int`, numbered 1-7 before and
`int=1 double=2 char=3` after, with 2->1, 3->2, 4->3, 5->2, 6->1, 7->1 in both
the `mov`s and the `.byte`s. `run.sh` runs all five on the host.

### The miscompile it turned up: a `try` inside a `catch`

**A `try` inside another one's *body* has been refused by name for a long time;
inside a *handler* it was not, and was silently miscompiled.** `inTryBody_` is
restored before the handlers are parsed, so nothing refused it. The parser
numbers a `try`'s handlers as it reads them - the outer `int` before its body -
while the backend registers rows innermost-first, so the parser wrote
`sel == 1` for the outer `int` and the table said index 1 was the inner
`double`.

    clang:  outer int 7 inner double 2.5 | end
    cxx1:   libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type int

Reproduced at `e731456` in a clean worktree, so it is older than the
deduplication and unrelated to it - and it was on the remote. **Refused by name
now**, with its sibling, and `try-in-handler-refused.cpp` records what clang
prints so the refusal can be lifted against a known answer rather than a guess.

**No suite had the shape.** It was found by asking whether the parser's
numbering and the backend's could ever disagree - a question about a *coupling*
rather than about a feature, which is not what a corpus is made of.

**The fix proposed here was the wrong one, and saying so is the point.** "Let
the indices travel on the `Try` node instead of being derived twice" was written
in this section and then *done*, later the same day - and the miscompile
survived it unchanged. The numbering was never what broke this case. See "Two
implementations of one numbering, and the filler that actually breaks a
handler".

### The golden is not in git, and this round re-recorded it

`tests/out-emit.golden` is gitignored, so the ten changed emissions are not in
the commit and a fresh clone has no golden at all. Re-recording is a local act
and has to be stated rather than shown: **717 files, and the run after it reads
`0 of 717 changed`.**

## A destructible object inside a `try` body

**Landed 2026-09-07**, and it is rung 6.4's other half: a local beside a `try`
worked, one *inside* its body did not.

### Why the obvious relaxation is a `terminate`

A cleanup region is a call-site row, and one built inside a `try` body is a row
*within* the `try`'s range. **The personality routine's phase 1 takes the first
row whose range holds the PC**, and if that row is cleanup-only it offers no
handler - so the whole frame is skipped and nothing here ever runs. Measured by
lifting the refusal and nothing else:

    clang:  +outer +a +b -b -a | caught | end -outer
    cxx1:   +outer +a +b   then libc++abi: terminating

**It was never about the ranges.** Overlapping nested rows already work - a
nested block inside a plain function emits `[try.1, tryend.1)` before
`[try.0, tryend.0)` with the inner genuinely inside the outer, and unwinding
through it is correct. What was missing was *types*: the inner row carried none.

**And it is not clang's model.** clang emits disjoint address-ordered ranges
partitioning the function, every PC in exactly one record, nesting resolved at
compile time. cxx1 nests at run time and resolves by first match. Sorting cxx1's
rows to look like clang's is the change that silently broke nested unwinding a
round earlier and was reverted; the two models are different and this one stays.

### What it does instead

Every segment of the body carries the **`try`'s catch types**, so phase 1 finds
a handler at a PC inside the body. Each segment's pad destroys what the body
built and then **jumps to one shared chain** in the `try`'s own pad, which is
where the selector is tested - a `Label` and a `Goto` with a `$` in the name,
because no C++ identifier holds one and it therefore cannot collide with a
user's label. `setAlsoCleanup` puts the trailing filter-0 on those rows, or
phase 2 installs no pad where nothing matched and the destructors never run.

`Walker::visit(const Try &)` pushes its `callSite` **after** walking the body,
so a segment's row is registered before the `try`'s without anything being
sorted - the innermost-first order this table wants, for free.

**The prerequisite was the type table**: two rows now name the same `_ZTI`, so
one type had to mean one selector index. That is its own section above, and it
was a hang before it was a feature.

### The pad destroys from the `try`'s entry, not from its own block's

**A pad that jumps to the chain is the last one to run in this frame**, so a
nested block inside the body has to destroy what the body built above it too.
Before that, `try { A o; { A i; boom(); } }` gave `+o +i -i` where clang gives
`+o +i -i -o`: one destructor short, and the trace was the only sign.

**The ledger is what caught it** - `gone=7 live=1` against clang's
`gone=8 live=0` - which is the case the instrument was built for. A leak that
also happens to show in a trace is luck; the counter does not depend on luck.

### The evidence that nothing else moved

24 emissions changed, twelve exception cases across both Itanium targets, and
**every changed line in all 24 is an added `$chain` label** - checked
mechanically rather than by reading a sample. No instruction, no table entry and
no row moved in any case that existed before, because none of them had this
shape. Given that the previous change to this machinery was a silent leak all
four suites passed, that check is the point.

### Still refused, and the reasons are structural

**A destructible local inside a `catch` handler.** A handler is emitted past the
`try`'s range, so its region is inside no row: there is nothing to carry types
on and no chain to hand a selector to. It wants a region of its own, and that is
its own step. **And x86_64-windows**, where a cleanup is a funclet and a state
in the FH3 tables rather than a row in a call-site list, so none of this
splitting has a counterpart - `wrapMsCleanups` is untouched.

### Two case-writing rules this round re-learned the hard way

**No handler in a case may `return`.** `return` inside a `catch` is refused for
x86_64-windows, so a case whose handler returns meets *that* refusal first on
that box and never reaches the one it is about. `local-in-handler-refused.cpp`
was written that way and the Windows leg reported it - the Mac and the Linux box
were both green. `catch-by-reference.cpp` already had the rule.

**Define a case's constructors out of line.** clang emits an inline-defined one
as a comdat `linkonce_odr` and cxx1 as an ordinary definition, and `names.sh`
then reports an emission difference wearing the shape of a mangling one.

## A thrown temporary, and the three faults behind one refusal

**Landed 2026-09-07.** `throw Msg("hello")` is how every real program raises an
exception and how `<stdexcept>` will be used, and it was refused inside a `try`.
Lifting the refusal was the plan; what it uncovered was three faults that had to
be fixed together, because fixing the middle one alone makes the program worse.

### The three

**The exception object was a block copy.** `*(T *)ex = value` is an `Assign` of
a class, which moves bytes - neither the copy constructor nor `operator=` runs,
measured by making both print. For a class owning a buffer, the exception object
was handed a pointer *into the temporary*.

**The operand's temporaries were never destroyed.** The whole throw was built as
one expression - `(save, store), thrower` - so there was nowhere to put the
destruction between initialising the exception object and throwing. The
temporary stayed in `pendingTemps_` for whatever was parsed next: a
`throw E(1)` inside a `try` leaked its `E` into the **handler's** block, where
its destructor was emitted at the end of the handler's first statement.

**`__cxa_throw`'s third argument was null**, written when only fundamental types
could be thrown. The runtime destroyed no exception object, so a class holding a
buffer leaked it once per throw.

**Fixing the second alone turns the first from a leak into a use-after-free** -
measured: the handler read `[]` where clang read `[hello]`. That is why the
refusal was right to exist and why it could not simply be lifted.

### What it does now

Copy-construct into the exception object through `copyConstructorOf`, falling
back to the byte copy only where there is no copy constructor - a trivially
copyable class, or a fundamental type, which is what this always did. Then
`flushTemporaries`, which is [except.throw]/3's order: the exception object is
initialised, *then* the operand's temporaries are destroyed. Then the throw,
carrying the class's destructor so `__cxa_end_catch` destroys the object.

Three statements where there was one expression, which is the whole reason the
middle one now has somewhere to go.

**The emit golden read `0 of 719 files changed`.** With no temporaries
`flushTemporaries` appends nothing, and no case in the tree threw a class with a
copy constructor or a destructor - so the restructure is invisible to everything
that existed, and nothing existing exercised the new path either. That is what
`throw-temporary.cpp` is for.

### The case is written to be elision-invariant

[class.copy]/31 lets an implementation build the exception object directly from
the operand. clang does; cxx1 does not, so cxx1 constructs two objects here and
clang one. **Counting constructions would be counting a permitted choice**, so
the case prints an outstanding-allocation *balance* and what the handler read,
never a total - and it cannot pass with any of the three faults undone.

### What it exposed and did not fix

`names.sh` reported that clang emits `__cxa_free_exception` and cxx1 does not.
That is the cleanup for a copy constructor that throws while the exception
object is being initialised: the storage has an owner for the length of the copy
and none afterwards. It is the open item the handover already lists, and it
became **visible** rather than new - until the object was copy-constructed there
was no copy that could throw. Recorded in `throw-temporary.nonames`, with the
note that nothing in this tree can reach it, cxx1 having no `bad_alloc` to raise.

### And the sequence is worth recording, because it was mine

The crash this round fixes was reachable only because the previous round
narrowed a refusal. `throw M(5)` in a function with no `try` compiled before and
after; what changed is that the *catching* side stopped being refused, so the
program could be written, linked and run - and it aborted. Measured at
`e65f27f`: refused. At `3ab23b4`: `rc=138`. **A refusal being lifted is a claim
that what it guarded is now safe**, and that claim needs the same measurement as
a feature. It did not get one, and the crash went to the remote.

## Two implementations of one numbering, and the filler that actually breaks a handler

**Landed 2026-09-07**, two cleanups that Fable's audit of the type table left
behind - and the second of them disproved the audit's own recommendation, which
is the more useful half.

### The indices travel now, and it changed nothing

A selector is an index into the function's type table. The parser writes
`if (sel == n)` into the handler chain; the backend wrote `n` into the action
record. **Two implementations of one numbering**, agreeing by convention. They
are one now: the parser's numbers ride on the `Try` node, and `lsdaTable`
*places* entry `n-1` rather than deriving `n` from the order it met the rows in.

`0 of 721 files changed`. That is the whole evidence that it is a restructuring:
who computes the index moved, what the index *is* did not.

### It did not fix the `try` inside a `catch`, and that was the test

The miscompile this was supposed to make impossible was measured again with the
refusal lifted, and it is unchanged:

    clang:  outer int 7 inner double 2.5 | end
    cxx1:   libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type int

So the numbering caused the *hang* - a shared type numbered twice - and never
caused this. **A fix that removes a real fragility is not thereby a fix for the
bug you blamed on it**, and the only way that showed was lifting the refusal and
running the program again rather than reasoning that it must now work.

### What does break it: a filler row of negative length

`lsdaTable` writes a gap row before each real one, `[at, c.begin)`, with `at`
walking to each row's end. **That subtraction is negative whenever the rows are
not in ascending address order**, and it is assembled as a `uleb128`: measured
in the object file as `ff ff ff ff 01`, about 5.4x10^8.

Rows are registered innermost-first, and for a *nested block* that is harmless -
measured twice, including the shape the reverted address sort broke, and both
unwind correctly. A **handler's** region is where it bites: its code is emitted
past the `try`'s range, so its row is registered first and begins at a *higher*
address than the row that follows it. The gap goes backwards, the huge length
swallows the rest of the function, and the outer handler is never reached.

**This was predicted, tested, and retracted earlier the same day.** A throw
placed after a nested block - which should have hit the same gap - unwound
correctly, so the finding was recorded as an encoding oddity with no
demonstrated harm. It needed rows genuinely out of address order, which only a
handler's region produces, and the probe had not produced one. **Recorded now as
the named cause**, and it is what a durable `try`-inside-`catch` needs: rows
that cover a handler either sorted into place or emitted so that registration
order and address order agree.

### And `CallSite::order` is gone

A field holding a label id, assigned and read by nothing - the residue of the
address sort that was reverted. Its comment was the worse half: it explained how
sorting by that id restores address order, which reads as live design for
something the tree deliberately does not do. Both replaced by a note saying rows
are used in registration order and never sorted, and pointing at why.

## The implicit destructor of an intermediate class, which nothing emitted

**Fixed 2026-09-07**, and it is one line. `C : B : A` with a destructor written
only on `A` **failed to link**:

    Undefined symbols: "B2::~B2()", referenced from: C2::~C2()

`B`'s destructor is implicit and exists only to destroy its `A` subobject; `C`'s
is implicit and calls `B`'s. `synthesizeDestructor` builds that call through
`completeCall` directly and **never marked the callee used** - where
`destructorCall` does, saying so in a comment ("calling one is what asks for a
body"), and where `synthesizeCopy` marks its bases and its members.
`defineImplicitFunctions` runs to a fixed point *for exactly this reason* and
was simply never told, so `B`'s destructor was emitted by nobody.

**Two levels hid it**, because there the base's destructor is the written one
and has a body whoever asks. It took a third class - the first whose destructor
is implicit *and* whose caller is also implicit. Four levels work now too, which
is the fixed point doing what it was built for.

**No exceptions, templates or virtuals are anywhere near it.** It is a plain
C++98 shape that did not link, and it went unnoticed because no case in the tree
had a three-level chain with an implicit middle. It was found on the way to
something else - probing catch-by-base for `<stdexcept>`, which is that
hierarchy exactly: a base, an intermediate adding nothing but its own type, and
concrete classes below. `catcher2.cpp`'s `CustomError : std::runtime_error` is
three deep.

**The case carries no `throw`, deliberately.** The shape that found this was a
three-level object thrown and caught by its top base, and a `throw C2(3)` makes
the trace elision-dependent: cxx1 builds the temporary and copy-constructs the
exception object where clang builds one, so cxx1 destroys twice and clang once,
and [class.copy]/31 allows both. The destructor chain needs no exception to
demonstrate - and without one the case runs on x86_64-windows too, where a class
throw is still refused.

## `<stdexcept>`, which is three lines per class because of what is under it

**Landed 2026-09-07**, and it is the header `catcher1.cpp` and `catcher2.cpp`
have stopped at since they were first tried. `catcher1.cpp` now compiles
unmodified and prints what clang prints - **686 lines of stdout and 314 of
stderr, both streams byte-identical**.

**The header is small because the work was done elsewhere.** Each class holds a
`std::string` and `what()` returns its buffer, which [exception]/8 permits: the
pointer stays valid while the object does. So the string owns the bytes, its
copy constructor copies them and its destructor frees them, and not one of the
nine classes writes a copy constructor, a destructor or a `what()` body beyond
`return msg_.c_str();`.

What that leans on all landed the same day, and any one of them missing makes
the header useless rather than imperfect:

- the exception object **copy-constructed** from the thrown operand rather than
  block-copied - otherwise the buffer is shared with a temporary and freed under
  the handler, which read `[]`
- the operand's temporaries **destroyed** after that copy
- `__cxa_throw` told the class's **destructor**, or the string leaks per throw
- the **implicit destructor of an intermediate class** emitted, without which
  `domain_error : logic_error : exception` did not link at all

### `std::exception` is in `<exception>`, and that was measured

Not assumed: libc++ was asked. `<exception>` alone does not declare
`runtime_error` - "no member named 'runtime_error' in namespace 'std'" - and
`<stdexcept>` alone does declare `exception`, because it includes the other.
cxx1's two headers split the same way for the same reason.

### The same header *set*, not the same headers

Adopting the platform's own headers was tried and fails on line 48 of the first
file libc++'s `<stdexcept>` opens: `#if __has_include(<picolibc.h>)`, a C++17
preprocessor feature. Those headers are a front end for one compiler's builtins
- `_LIBCPP_ABI_*`, attributes, variadic templates, `constexpr`,
`__is_trivially_copyable` - and reaching them means implementing C++17's
preprocessor and most of `docs/EXCLUSIONS.md` first.

**What is shared is the interface**: the header names, the class names, the
hierarchy, the constructors, and which header declares what. That is what makes
a program compile unchanged, which is the only sense in which this matters.

### `to_string`, and the digits come off the negative side

`<string>` gained it because both catcher programs build their messages with it.
`-v` is undefined for the most negative value of a signed type, so the loop runs
on `x <= 0` and turns each remainder round with `'0' - x % 10`; C++11 fixed `%`
to truncate toward zero, so a negative dividend gives a non-positive remainder.
**30 emissions changed and every changed line is an addition** - checked
mechanically, zero lines removed or altered - which is what adding a function to
a header should do.

### Where `catcher2.cpp` stops now

Not at the header: at a **`try` inside a `try`**, line 27, which is the older
nested-`try` refusal and the same call-site-table problem as `try` inside a
`catch`. Its likely cause is already written down a section above - the filler
row of negative length. That is now the last thing between this compiler and the
second of the two programs.

## The `__has_*` predicates, and four walls that were all this compiler's

**Landed 2026-09-07**, and the round exists because of a question rather than a
feature: could cxx1 use a native compiler's headers instead of shipping its own?
The measurement was worth more than the answer.

### The predicates

`__has_include` is answered truthfully - the same search `#include` does - and
`__has_builtin`, `__has_feature`, `__has_attribute` and their neighbours answer
**0**. That is not a dodge: `#if __has_builtin(X)` is written by a library
precisely so it can be told no, and 0 is what a compiler without X answers.

**`__is_identifier` is the one that answers 1.** It asks whether a token is an
ordinary identifier rather than a keyword or a builtin, and here everything is.
Answering 0 says "that name is special", and libstdc++'s
`_GLIBCXX_HAS_BUILTIN(B)`, which is `__has_builtin(B) || ! __is_identifier(B)`,
then reads `0 || !0` and concludes the builtin exists.

**They are resolved twice, before and after expansion.** Before, because
`__has_include(<vector>)`'s argument is a header name and macro-expanding it
would make nonsense of the `<` and `>`. After, because a library wraps them:
`_GLIBCXX_HAS_BUILTIN` is not those tokens until the line has been expanded.

**And they answer `#ifdef`, not only `defined()`.** libstdc++ guards its whole
builtin layer with `#ifdef __has_builtin` - a directive, handled by a different
path. Teaching only the `#if` path left the guard false, the macro undefined,
and a use of it two thousand lines later reaching the expression parser as
`0(__has_unique_object_representations)`.

### A comment on a directive line is whitespace

[lex.phases]/3 replaces a comment in phase 3 and directives execute in phase 4,
so a condition should never see one. `stripComments` already existed and
`#define`'s body already went through it; a condition did not, so
`#if EXPR // why` stopped at the `/`. Every real header writes them.

### What the probe actually measured

Four fixes carried cxx1 from **zero headers deep** into libstdc++ to parsing
real library code:

    before   bits/c++config.h, the configure-generated layer, every header
    after    bits/move.h:197, std::swap's conditional noexcept

**The config layer was not the obstacle**, which is what this round was meant to
find out. Every one of the four is something cxx1 should have had anyway, and
none of them is about the library. What stops it now is the *language* -
variadic templates, `__and_`-style SFINAE, conditional `noexcept` - which is
`docs/EXCLUSIONS.md`, a list with named refusals and a countable cost.

**And the intrinsics were the cheap part, not the blocker.** `__is_base_of`,
`__is_polymorphic`, `__has_virtual_destructor` are compiler builtins because the
compiler already holds the answer - and cxx1 holds it too, in `Type::bases()`,
`Type::polymorphic()` and `destructorOf()`. Saying they "cannot be written in
C++" is true and was the wrong thing to draw from: it makes them sound
expensive, and they are a few lines each reading data this compiler already
keeps to do its own job.

### The case had to be rewritten to be a case at all

Its first version printed `builtin=1` under clang and `0` under cxx1 - both
correct - so its `.expected` was taken from cxx1's own output, which checks a
compiler against itself. It asks about a builtin **neither** has now, so both
answer 0, the expectation is clang's like every other case here, and what it
measures is the mechanism rather than the answer.

## Regions that do not overlap, and the sort that was premature rather than wrong

**Landed 2026-09-07.** A `try` inside a `catch` handler works; one inside a
`try` *body* is refused for a reason now written down precisely. What changed is
the shape of the call-site table.

### Split on the way in, not sorted on the way out

`Walker::openRegion` closes the enclosing region at the inner one's first label
and reopens it at the inner's last. One region becomes several rows, all naming
the same pad and the same types - they are one region to the program, several
rows only because something nested had to be cut out of the range.

**And that is what finally makes sorting safe.** The gap row written in front of
each real one is `[at, c.begin)`, with `at` walking to each row's end - so a row
beginning before the previous one ended gives a *negative* length, assembled as
a uleb128 of about 5.4x10^8, swallowing the rest of the function. Nested regions
did exactly that.

**The sort reverted a round earlier was not wrong about address order. It was
premature.** Overlapping rows need the innermost first, because the personality
takes the first row whose range holds the address; a linear scan cannot be given
both orders at once. Split the regions and the conflict is gone: nothing
overlaps, first-match no longer depends on the order, so the order can be the
one the arithmetic needs. The case that sort silently broke -
`A outer; { A inner; boom(); }` - runs correctly now *with* sorting on.

### The enclosing region reopens at the inner's end, not past its pad

So it still covers the inner's landing pad and handler, which is what a throw
from inside a `catch` needs: it belongs to the `try` outside it.

### What this did not fix, and exactly what it wants

A `try` inside a `try` **body** still terminates, and the overlap was not its
cause either. Measured from clang for that program:

    Action 5: catch TypeInfo 2 (double), continue to action 4
    Action 4: catch TypeInfo 1 (int), no further

**One record's action chain carries every handler that encloses the address.**
cxx1 gives a row its own types and stops, so an `int` thrown in the inner body
finds no `int` in the chain, phase 1 concludes the frame has no handler, and the
frame is skipped. With that fixed the pad would have to hand over as well: the
runtime lands at the *inner's* pad, since that is the pad its record names, and
`_Unwind_Resume` from there leaves for the caller rather than trying the region
outside it in the same frame.

Both are named in `try-in-try-body-refused.cpp`.

### The evidence that nothing else moved

18 emissions changed, nine cases across both Itanium targets, and **every
changed line is `.uleb128`, `.byte` or a label** - checked mechanically, zero
instructions altered. That is the signature of rows being reordered and split
and nothing else. `run.sh` runs all nine, `lifetime-ledger`,
`return-copy-balance` and `jump-out-destroys` among them.

### A case that has been all three things

`try-in-handler.cpp` was a miscompile, then a refusal, and is now a runnable
case, and the file says so. Its first fix was the wrong one: the blame went to
the parser and backend numbering the selector twice, that was made
single-sourced, and the miscompile survived it unchanged. **A fix that removes a
real fragility is not thereby a fix for the bug you blamed on it.**

## A `try` inside a `try`, and the three mechanisms it wanted

**Landed 2026-09-07**, and with it all three programs in
`~/Documents/Claude/lambdaTest` compile and run byte-identically to clang -
`lambda.cpp`, `catcher1.cpp` at 686 lines of stdout and 314 of stderr, and
`catcher2.cpp` at 40 and 26. Those three are what opened the day.

Nesting took three mechanisms, and each was found by the previous one failing.

**The regions must not overlap.** `Walker::openRegion` splits the enclosing one
around the inner, closing at its first label and reopening at its last. That
alone made a `try` inside a `catch` work, and here it was necessary and not
sufficient.

**The action chain must continue outwards.** Measured from clang: the record
covering the inner body reads `catch double, continue to action 4`, and action 4
is the outer's `catch int`. One record's chain names every handler enclosing the
address, and phase 1 walks all of it before deciding the frame has none. cxx1
gave a row its own types and stopped, so the `int` was never found and the frame
was skipped entirely.

**And the pad must hand over rather than resume.** With the chain fixed, phase 1
picks the outer's `int` and phase 2 lands at the *inner* region's pad, because
that is the pad its record names. `_Unwind_Resume` from there leaves for the
caller and never tries the region outside this one in the same frame - measured
as an **infinite loop**, `ulimit -t` catching it as SIGXCPU. So the selector goes
to the enclosing chain, which is the one place that tests it for those types.

### Two things fell out of the third

A nested `try` **shares the enclosing region's `.ex.ptr` and `.ex.sel` slots**,
or the chain reads a slot nothing on that path wrote - measured as a crash. And
the chain label is numbered from a counter rather than from the slot, which
collided the moment the slots were shared: `symbol '.L.main.user.$chain0.8' is
already defined`.

### The evidence, and a filter that lied about it

32 emissions changed, and the first check said **130 lines were neither table
data nor labels** - which would have been instructions moving. It was the check
that was wrong: these labels begin `.L` at column 0 and the pattern matched a
bare `L`. Corrected, the count is **0**: table data and chain-label renames
only, across all 32. Worth keeping because a filter that under-reports is the
same danger as a suite that does - and this one over-reported, which is the
harmless direction, only because the labels changed name at the same time.

### x86_64-windows keeps the whole refusal

A Microsoft handler is a funclet named `<fn>$catch$N` from a per-function
counter, so a nested one takes a name already used: ml64 answers
`A2005: symbol redefinition` and then `A1010: unmatched block nesting`. All
three mechanisms here are to the Itanium call-site list, which that ABI does not
have. `msTryStatement` is untouched, and the Windows box is what caught it while
both Itanium targets were green.

## namespace, and the fact that a namespace is not a type

**A namespace has no `Type`, and everything else here follows from that.** A
nested class is a member of an enclosing class, so `Outer::Inner` has an
`enclosing()` the manglers walk and the substitution tables recognise by
pointer. There is no object to point at for `N::S`, so a class declared inside
a namespace carries its scope in its **tag** - the same string key every table
in the parser already uses - and the manglers split the tag instead.

That makes one thing ambiguous, and it is worth naming because it cost a green
suite: a **local** class's tag has a `::` in it too. `f::L` is one name, not a
scope, and both ABIs spell it whole. Splitting on the spelling turned every
lambda into `10operator()` and broke two cases that had nothing to do with
namespaces. `Type::inNamespace()` is a flag set where the tag is built, and the
manglers ask it rather than looking for a `::`.

**Lookup is a search, written once.** `qualifyForLookup(name, exists)` tries the
enclosing namespaces innermost-out, then the ones a `using namespace` has
opened, then the name as written, and returns the first key that answers - where
"answers" is a predicate passed in, so functions, globals and type names share
the walk. It is a fallback and not a merge; `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` records what
that costs.

**Argument-dependent lookup, as far as an operator needs it.** `a + b` where
both are `N::V` has to find `N::operator+`, and nothing brings it into scope:
the call site is outside N and wrote no qualification, which is the whole point
of writing the operator beside its class. `lookupKeys` adds the operand types'
own namespaces to the names tried, for operators and for ordinary calls alike.

### What was measured

Both ABIs write a namespace exactly the way they write a class scope, which is
the useful part - nothing new had to be invented, only reached.

```
N::f(N::S, N::S)            _ZN1N1fENS_1SES0_        ?f@N@@YAHUS@1@0@Z
N::M::g(N::M::T, N::S)      _ZN1N1M1gENS0_1TENS_1SE  ?g@M@N@@YAHUT@12@US@2@@Z
outer(N::S, N::M::T)        _Z5outerN1N1SENS_1M1TE   ?outer@@YAHUS@N@@UT@M@2@@Z
N::B's vtable               _ZTVN1N1BE               ??_7B@N@@6B@
N::operator+(N::V, N::V)    _ZN1NplENS_1VES0_        ??HN@@YA?AUV@0@U10@0@Z
```

Two traps in there, both found by the names suite rather than by reading:

**Every namespace prefix is an Itanium substitution candidate, and the longest
one wins.** `_ZN1N1M1gENS0_1TENS_1SE` has `S_` standing for N and `S0_` for
`N::M` - so a candidate is registered per cumulative prefix, and writing `S_`
for N followed by `S0_` for `N::M` spells the same scope twice. A namespace is
not a `Type`, so these go in the table by name; `substitutedName` already
existed for template names and took them unchanged.

**An operator written in a namespace keeps its Microsoft code.** `??HN@@YA...`,
not `?operator+@N@@YA...`. The scoped branch of `Microsoft::function` had been
written for ordinary names and asked `operatorPrefix` only in the unscoped one.

### What is refused

`namespace { }` (the linkage is the feature, and `static` says it in one word),
`namespace N::M { }` (C++17), `namespace A = N;`, `using N::f;` - the
using-*declaration*, which is a different rule from the directive - and a
leading `::`. Each has a case in `tests/cases`.

`using namespace N;` works at file scope and inside a block, where it reaches
the closing brace and no further: `block()` truncates the list on the way out,
which is the whole of the scoping.

## nullptr, which the backends never heard about

**At the machine it is a pointer-sized zero and nothing else.** `Num(0)` with a
type on it is the whole of the code generation, and no backend changed. What
the type buys is entirely in the front end: a null pointer constant stops being
spelled the same as the number 0.

That single fact is the feature. `f(0)` picks `f(int)`, because 0 is an int
that happens to convert; `f(nullptr)` picks `f(char *)`, because
std::nullptr_t is not an integer and `f(int)` is not viable for it at all. And
`int n = nullptr;` is a diagnostic rather than a zero.

**Where the kind sits in the enum is load-bearing, twice.** `Kind::NullPtr` is
between `Void` and `Bool`: TypeTable builds one Type for every value in the
Void..Function range, so a fundamental type has to be inside it; and
`isInteger()` is a range check starting at `Bool`, so anything before `Bool` is
automatically not an integer - which is the one thing this type must never be
mistaken for.

**Most of the work was already written.** `isNullConstant` was the parser's
name for "the literal 0 in a pointer context", and it gates comparison, the
`?:` arms and the conversion. Teaching it that `nullptr` is one too made all
three work without a new call site.

### The bool rule, which is the part worth not guessing

[conv.bool] gives std::nullptr_t a conversion to bool **for direct-
initialization only**. An argument is copy-initialized, so `f(bool)` is not a
candidate for `nullptr` at all - not a candidate that ranks worse. Measured:
with `f(bool)` alone clang says there is no matching function, and against
`f(char *)` it picks the pointer with no ambiguity to report. Ranking bool
beside the pointer conversion would have invented that ambiguity.

Meanwhile std::nullptr_t **is** a scalar ([basic.types]/9), so `!nullptr`,
`nullptr && x` and `if (nullptr)` all work - a contextual conversion that
`convert()` lowers to a comparison against zero like any other. The two live
together because the diagnostic gate for copy-initialization
(`requireConvertible`) is a different function from the lowering (`convert`),
and only the second was taught the conversion.

### What was measured

```
void f(decltype(nullptr))    _Z1fDn                   ?f@@YAX$$T@Z
sizeof(nullptr)              8
```

`decltype(nullptr)` is how a program spells the type here; the name
`std::nullptr_t` needs `<cstddef>` and there are no headers. Diagnostics print
`std::nullptr_t` all the same, because that is what it is called.

Conversions run both ways at the same rank - `nullptr` reaches any pointer and
any pointer to data member, and the literal 0 reaches std::nullptr_t - so
`f(void *)` against `f(char *)` is ambiguous for `nullptr`, and
`f(decltype(nullptr))` against `f(char *)` is ambiguous for `0`. Both are
refusals clang makes, and both have a case in `tests/overload/`.

### What is refused

`int n = nullptr;`, `bool b = nullptr;`, ordering (`nullptr < nullptr`,
`p < nullptr`), arithmetic, `*nullptr`, and `++` on a std::nullptr_t object.
Each has a case.

One shape it does **not** reach, and not because of nullptr: a pointer to
member *function* has no null value yet by any spelling - `= 0` is refused in
the same words - because it is two words on both ABIs and zeroing it is a
struct store rather than a scalar one.

## static_assert, a declaration that declares nothing

The condition is folded in the parser and a zero is a diagnostic carrying the
program's own words. **Nothing reaches the AST**, so no backend, no emitter and
no mangler heard about this feature - which is what makes it one function,
`staticAssertion()`, called from three loops rather than three implementations.
Those three are file scope (`topLevel`), a block (`statementBody`, where it
becomes the empty statement the way a using-directive does) and a class body
(the member loop in `ParserType.cpp`) - three places in two files, and the rule
is one rule.

`fold` already existed, for array bounds and enumerators and `case` labels, so
the constant evaluation is not new work. What is new is one parse and three
call sites.

### The message is required, and that was measured rather than read

C++17 made it optional; C++11 did not. **clang accepts the one-argument form
under `-std=c++11`** and only calls it an extension under `-pedantic-errors` -
so a default clang build would have said the form was fine. It is refused here
for the same reason `namespace N::M {}` is: a file that builds here must not
stop building on the C++11 compiler it was written for.

### What it deliberately does not accept

The condition has to be an **integral** constant expression, which is narrower
than the standard's "contextually converted constant expression of type bool".
`static_assert(1.5, "")` and `static_assert("abc", "")` are both legal and both
refused. Neither is a thing anybody writes, and `fold` answers about integers -
widening it is constant-evaluation work, not static_assert work.

The message must be written out as a literal, adjacent pieces included. A
`const char *` initialised beside it is refused, because the message is printed
by the compiler and there is no program running to read a variable.

### A trap in the *test*, not the compiler

`tests/cases/static-assert.cpp` asserts about a `constexpr` function and a
file-scope `const int`. clang emits **neither** symbol: a constexpr function
nobody odr-uses folds away, and so does a const int every reader of which is a
constant expression - a `printf` argument included. `names.sh` then reports
cxx1 emitting symbols clang did not, which looks like a naming failure and is a
difference about *emission*. The case calls the function and takes the
variable's address so both compilers emit both. Worth remembering the shape:
**when the names suite reports a symbol cxx1 has and clang does not, ask what
clang folded away before looking for a mangling bug.**

## explicit, which changes nothing about a function

`S s(3);` and `S s = 3;` call the same constructor with the same argument and
differ in one thing: whether that constructor may be chosen without being asked
for by name. So `explicit` is **one bool on the signature** - not on the class,
because it is one constructor of a set that is explicit - checked at each place
the standard calls copy-initialization. No mangled name, no vtable and no
emitted code changes.

The check is made **after** overload resolution rather than by hiding the
constructor from the candidate set. That way the reader is told which
constructor was found and why it could not be used, instead of that nothing
matched - which sends them looking for a constructor that is there.

### The three copy-initializations, and only one is written with an '='

This is where the work was, and finding all three took measuring rather than
reading:

* **`S s = x;`** - the obvious one, in `constructLocal`.
* **`return s;`** - [class.copy]/31 copy-initializes the caller's object, so a
  class whose copy constructor is `explicit` **cannot be returned by value at
  all**. The function is ill-formed on its own, before any caller is looked at.
  And the rule is checked *even though this compiler elides the copy* - the
  constructor is selected and checked whether or not it is called.
* **A by-value parameter** - [dcl.init]/17, in `materialiseCopy`. The least
  obvious of the three, because nothing at the call site has an '=' in it.

Two of those reach past `constructLocal`, and the elision branch reaches past
it as well - `S b = make();` builds straight into `b` and calls no copy
constructor, and is still refused. **Where the rule is checked and where the
call happens are different places**, which is the shape to remember: a check
attached to the code that emits the call would have missed all three.

### What it is not able to do here yet

`explicit` on a **conversion function** is the other place C++11 allows it, and
this compiler has no conversion functions at all - so the refusal names *that*
rather than saying the keyword applies to constructors, which would send the
reader to fix the wrong half.

And `explicit` bites in fewer places here than in a full C++ compiler simply
because cxx1 has fewer implicit conversions: a converting constructor is not
tried for a function argument or a return value at all, so there is nothing for
`explicit` to stop there. What it does stop is real; what it would stop is not
reachable yet.

### A test trap, the second of its kind

For a constructor defined **inside** its class, clang on x86_64-linux emits
only the base-object `C2` and calls it, where cxx1 emits and calls the
complete-object `C1`. Both are self-consistent, both link, and each translation
unit carries its own inline copy - so nothing is broken. But `names.sh` reads
it as seven disagreements. Defined out of line, both compilers emit both.

That is the same lesson as the constexpr-and-const-int one under
static_assert, and now it has happened twice: **when the names suite reports a
disagreement on a case that changes no names, the case is usually asking the
two compilers a question about emission.**

## The named casts

`static_cast` was already here. This adds `const_cast` and `reinterpret_cast`,
and refused `dynamic_cast` by name - which has since been built; the subsection
below carries the correction rather than being edited away, because what the
refusal said at the time is why the work was scoped the way it was.

**Neither of the two generates anything.** Every conversion they allow is
between things of the same size, so the value is unchanged and what moves is
the type. What the code here does is *say which claim was made* - which is the
whole reason C++ gave each a name of its own instead of letting the C cast do
all of it silently.

### The line between them is const, and it runs both ways

`reinterpret_cast` may not take const off; `const_cast` may not change what is
pointed at. Letting either do the other's job would make one of them redundant,
and would let a program take a const off while looking like it was only
changing a type. Doing both means writing both, in either order. Both halves
have a refusal case.

`const_cast` also asks that the two types be **similar** in the standard's
sense: strip the pointers in lockstep, ignore the qualifiers at each step, and
arrive at the same type. `const int *const *` to `int **` is similar and legal;
`const int *` to `char *` is not. Only `const` is a qualifier this compiler
has - `volatile` is parsed and dropped - so that is the only thing either cast
can move.

### dynamic_cast was a rung, and it has since been walked

**This paragraph read "refused by name" until 2026-09-07 and was true when it
was written.** It asks what an object *actually* is, which only a `type_info`
beside its vtable can answer, and this compiler emitted none. All three parts
have since landed - the `type_info`, the inheritance graph it carries, and the
`__cxa_` call that walks it - so the pointer form works on all three targets,
and `dynamic_cast<void *>` with it. What is still refused is the **reference**
form, which needs `std::bad_cast` thrown, and a class naming **more than one
base**, which needs `__vmi_class_type_info`. See "`dynamic_cast<void *>`, and
two ABIs answering differently".

### `long` is not a portable pointer-sized integer

A `long` is 8 bytes on x86_64-linux and arm64-darwin and **4** on
x86_64-windows, so `reinterpret_cast<long>(p)` compiles on two targets and is
refused on the third. `long long` is 8 on all three. This was caught by
`emit.sh` - which compiles every case for every target and stops at assembly -
before any box was asked, which is what that suite is for: **a target-dependent
mistake in a case is cheapest to find on the machine you are sitting at.**

## noexcept, both of them

**In C++11 the exception specification is not part of the function's type.**
Measured: `void f() noexcept` and `void f()` both mangle to `_Z1fv` on Itanium
and `?f@@YAXXZ` on Microsoft. So no name, no overload set and no signature
match changes - which is most of why this rung is small. C++17 made it part of
the type; this compiler targets C++11.

Because nothing else holds a declaration and its definition together, **the two
have to say the same thing**, and that check is the only structural work the
specifier needs. clang refuses a mismatch in both directions and so does this;
without it the two would silently be one function carrying whichever promise
was read last.

`throw()` is the C++03 spelling and is taken as the same promise. `throw(T)` is
the *dynamic* exception specification - a different feature needing a run-time
check of the thrown type against a list - and is refused by name rather than
read as `throw()`, which would be a promise the program did not make.

### The operator counts during the parse

`noexcept(e)` does not run `e`. The operand is parsed for its meaning and
thrown away, the way `sizeof`'s is, and what is kept is whether anything in it
could throw. That is counted **while** it is being read rather than by walking
the tree afterwards, which keeps the whole thing to one integer: every call
already passes through `resolveOverload` (which knows which function it
reached) or `completeCall` with a non-null callee (a call through a pointer,
which promises nothing), and every `throw` through one place.

A call through a function pointer is always potentially-throwing, and that
falls out of the same rule that made this rung small: the promise is not part
of the type, so a `int (*)()` says nothing about what it points at.

### The specification is recorded and not enforced

A throw escaping a `noexcept` function propagates here where it should call
`std::terminate`. **The compile-time half is complete and exact** - the
operator agrees with clang everywhere it was measured - and the run-time half
is in `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` with the reason: enforcing it means wrapping every
such function in an implicit `try`, which would inherit the two try/catch
limits already recorded here and start refusing programs that work today. Lift
those first.

## A virtual base is built once, and the three paths that had to learn it

**[class.base.init]/7 gives every virtual base to the most-derived class**, and
the base subobject constructors it calls must not build them again. C2 was a
label on C1's body - which is right for every class without a virtual base, and
is what `Function::setAlias` is for - so `V` was built once per class that named
it: `+V +D1 +V +D2 +V +Dia` where clang gives `+V +D1 +D2 +Dia`, and three
destructions to match.

**The body carrying the user's code is emitted as C2**, with the virtual bases
skipped, and C1 is synthesised beside it: build them, then call C2. It falls
that way round because a wrapper cannot skip part of another function's body.

**Three paths needed it and the implicit one was worse than wrong.**
`synthesizeDefaultCtor` reached its virtual base *through the vtable* - and the
vptr that walk follows is stored after the bases are built, so it dereferenced
whatever the stack held. `struct D : virtual public V { };` with no constructor
written anywhere **segfaulted**. `synthesizeCopy` takes the same split with the
source forwarded, so `Dia b(a)` copy-constructs the one `V` out of `a`'s rather
than default-constructing it.

Verified by running on the Linux box - five shapes, all matching clang,
including the three that segfaulted. The emit golden read 2 of 735 changed,
both of them the new case, so nothing else in the tree moved.

**Still refused, then:** the VTT and the construction vtables, which nothing needs
until a virtual function is called from inside a base constructor - that is the
one `names.sh` difference the new case carried, clang emitting `_ZTT2D1` and
`_ZTC3Dia0_2D1` where this emitted neither. Written on 2026-09-15 - "Virtual
inheritance proper" below. And the whole feature on
x86_64-windows, where a virtual base is a vbtable: **cl says `sizeof(D)` is 24
where cxx1 says 16**, and reading a member of one stops with `codegen: this has
no address` - a message naming no feature, which is the invisible bucket again.

## The Microsoft virtual-base layout, written

The measurement above became code on 2026-09-10. What an object with a virtual
base holds on this ABI, and what cxx1 now emits for it:

  - a **vbptr** wherever a class has a virtual base and no non-virtual base
    already carries one. `Type` keeps two numbers: `vbptrOffset()`, where the
    pointer sits in this class, and `vbptrOwner()`, the class that introduced
    it.
  - a **vbtable** `??_8Cls@@7B@` of four-byte offsets measured **from the
    vbptr's own address**. Entry 0 steps back to the top of the class that
    introduced the pointer; the rest name the virtual bases in order.
  - a **store in every constructor**, once per class along the chain: the
    base's constructor writes the base's table and the derived one overwrites
    the same slot with its own, whose entries measure this object's layout.
  - **reaching the base** through `this + vbptrOffset + table[slot]`, where
    Itanium reads a `vbase_offset` from the vtable at a negative index.

Every size and every table matches cl: V 4, D1 24, R 32, Q 32, X 40, and
`??_8D1@@7B@ 0, 16`, `??_8R@@7B@ 0, 24`, `??_8Q@@7B@ -8, 16`,
`??_8X@@7B@ 0, 24`.

**Two numbers cl settled that would have been guessed wrong.** Entry 0 is *not*
minus this class's vbptr offset: `??_8Q@@7B@` is -8 because Q put its vfptr in
front of the pointer, but `??_8X@@7B@` for `X : A, D1` is 0 although X's vbptr
sits at 8 - because D1, which introduced it, keeps it at its own offset 0.
Hence `vbptrOwner`. And an inherited vbptr is *inside* its base, so its offset
here is the base's own plus where that base sits; reading it as the base's
number alone put X's table at 0 and made every entry eight bytes too large.

**`storeVptrs` had to be split.** `hasVptr()` is `polymorphic() ||
hasVirtualBase()` and the Microsoft path stored a vftable address at offset 0
for either reason, so `struct D : virtual V { int b; }` - which has no vftable
at all - got one written into its vbptr. A class gets a vftable where it
dispatches and a vbtable where it has a virtual base, either alone or both.

**The third box earned its place again.** The member read landed and the
*conversion* did not: `convert` had a `!target_.microsoftNames()` on the
virtual-base walk, so an `R *` handed to a `const V &` stepped to the constant
`publicBaseOffset` gives - V's place inside a D1, 16, where V sits at 24 in an
R - and read R's own member instead. Both suites on the Mac were green and so
was Linux; `windows cases: 437 passed, 1 failed` said `1 5` where every other
line of the same case was right. The two callers share
`microsoftVirtualBaseStep` now, which is the shape of the fix as much as the
fix: one arithmetic, two users.

**What is refused, and why one round did not close it.** A true diamond -
`Dia : D1, D2`, each naming V virtually - gets *two* tables from cl, named for
the base each serves: `??_8Dia@@7BD1@@@` (0, 40) and `??_8Dia@@7BD2@@@`
(0, 24), where a class with one table gets the plain name. One table under the
plain name would leave a `D2 *` reading D2's own, which says where V is in a
D2 and not where it is here: a silent miscompile where a refusal is honest.
Refused at the class, by name.

**And a defect this round found but did not cause.** `X : A, D1` needs the
*dynamic* base at offset 0 on the Itanium ABI - clang lays D1 first and A at 12
- where cxx1 lays the bases in the order written, leaves nothing dynamic at 0,
and segfaults reading the virtual base. x86_64-windows is right here for a
reason that is not luck: a vbptr need not sit at offset 0 the way a vptr must,
and cl lays A first too. tests/open/itanium-primary-base.cpp.

## The diamond, and cl's hidden most-derived flag

The layout round above left one refusal - a virtual base inherited along more
than one path - and lifting it turned out to be two things, of which only the
first was the diamond.

**The tables.** A class holding more than one vbptr gets one vbtable per
pointer, named for the *direct base* whose subobject holds it:
`??_8Dia@@7BD1@@@` (0, 40) and `??_8Dia@@7BD2@@@` (0, 24), where a class with a
single table keeps the plain `??_8X@@7B@`. cl names it after the direct base
and not after the class that introduced the pointer - `??_8Deep@@7BR2@@@`,
though R2 got its vbptr from D1. A secondary table lists *its own base's*
virtual bases in that base's order, because the code reading it was compiled
against that base and counts entries from there; the primary lists the whole
class's, so a virtual base another subobject brought in is appended to it.
Measured on `Two : E1, E2` where E1 names V and E2 names W:
`??_8Two@@7BE1@@@` is 0, 40, 44 and `??_8Two@@7BE2@@@` is 0, 28.

**And then the thing the diamond exposed rather than caused.** A virtual base
was being *constructed once per class that names it* on this target -
`+V +D1 +V +R` where clang gives `+V +D1 +R` - and that was true of the single
vbptr shapes too, which had shipped that way. What was missing is not a table
but the mechanism [class.base.init]/7 needs, and cl's is not Itanium's:

  - **a hidden `int` parameter, last**, on every constructor of a class with a
    virtual base, telling it whether it is building the complete object. It is
    not part of the mangled name, so `msVbaseCtors_` remembers by symbol which
    ones take one. Measured on `L::L(int, int)`: `this` in rcx, the arguments
    in rdx and r8d, the flag in r9d.
  - **an `if` at the top of the constructor** holding the vbtable pointer
    stores and the virtual base construction, and nothing else. The vftable
    store sits *after* the guard's label - cl's listing settles that.
  - **`??_DCls@@QEAAXXZ`, the vbase destructor**: `??1` destroys the class's own
    part and stops, and `??_D` calls it and then the virtual bases. That is
    Itanium's D1 and D2 under two Microsoft names, and every *complete*
    object's destruction goes to the wrapper - `??_G`, the deleting one,
    included.

So the Microsoft ABI has the same C1/C2 split this compiler already had; it
spells the constructor half as one function and a flag, and the destructor half
as two functions. The parser now skips virtual bases in the body on **both**
ABIs and hands them to the guard here or to C1 there, and the base subobject
calls pass 0 where a complete object passes 1. All of it goes through
`completeCall`, which is the one place a constructor call is built.

**Order matters and cost a cycle**: the guard has to wrap the base calls, not
sit among them. Written inside, it printed `+D1 +V +R` - the virtual base after
the non-virtual one, where cl's `R::R` stores the vbtable pointer, calls
`V::V`, and only then `D1::D1`.

`virtual-base-diamond` and `virtual-base-initialiser` run on all three targets
now; they had been skipped on this one since the feature began.

**Three defects the round found and did not cause**, all registered in
tests/open: `X : A, D1` needs the dynamic base at offset 0 on Itanium
(itanium-primary-base); a second base with a virtual base of its own reads the
wrong one there (virtual-base-second-base); and `delete p` through a pointer to
a *polymorphic virtual base* never reaches the most-derived destructor on
either ABI (virtual-dtor-through-virtual-base). The register is eight.

## The primary base, which need not be the one written first

Itanium requires a dynamic class's vptr at offset 0, so the **first
non-virtual base carrying a vptr is laid there** whatever its place in the
base-clause. `X : A, D1` with A plain and D1 holding a virtual base: clang
puts D1 at 0 with its vptr and A at 12, and cxx1 put A at 0 - so a `D1 *` into
an X read A's first int as a vptr and the program died on the first
virtual-base member. `Type::primaryBase()` records the choice.

**`bases()` is not reordered**, and that is the whole trick to keeping the
change small: the list stays in the order written, which is the order the
bases are built and the reverse of the order they are destroyed, and only the
offsets say where each one landed. The construction trace is `V A D1 X` before
and after, which is what clang prints.

Two places had been treating "the first base" as "the base at offset 0" - the
secondary-table loop in `emitVtable` and the secondary-vptr store in
`storeVptrs` - and both now skip the primary by identity as well as by
position. `inheritsVptr` becomes "there is a primary base", which is also the
right answer for a class whose first *written* base is virtual: that one sits
at the end of the object and hands nothing down.

**Microsoft has no such rule and must not get one.** cl lays the bases in the
order written - A at 0, D1's vbptr at 8, V at 32, sizeof 40 - because a vbptr
need not sit at offset 0 the way a vptr must, and cxx1 already matched that
byte for byte. `primaryBase()` is null there and the layout loop degenerates to
the written order. The evidence that it stayed that way is the golden: **0 of
789 files changed**, three added, and the new case's x86_64-windows emission
byte-identical before and after.

**And a worse defect found beside it**, registered rather than fixed:
`struct Z : A { int z; virtual int f(); }` with A plain **segfaults**. There is
no primary base to take the vptr from, so Z must put one at offset 0 *in front
of* A; cxx1 keeps A at 0 and shifts only Z's own members, and the vtable store
lands on `A::x`. Mending it moves every base, after which a single base is no
longer at offset 0 and Z's type_info becomes `__vmi_class_type_info`, which
this compiler does not write - so `dynamic_cast` and `catch` on such a class
belong to the same round. The Microsoft branch shifts only the class's own
members too, so that target is expected to fail alike, but cl has not been
asked. tests/open/own-vptr-plain-base.cpp.

This round was written by a Fable 5.1 subagent in its own worktree, and every
number above was re-measured here before it landed - which is the only way a
handed-over green is worth anything.

## A class's own vptr goes in front of its bases - and then the type_info

`Z : A { int z; virtual int f(); }` with A a plain struct: Z is dynamic and A
is not, so there is no base to take a vptr from and Z must put one at offset 0
**in front of** A. Both oracles give the same four numbers - vptr 0, A 8, z 12,
sizeof 16, from clang's `-fdump-record-layouts` and cl's
`/d1reportSingleClassLayout` - and cxx1 laid A at 0 and moved only Z's *own*
members down, so the constructor's vtable store landed on `A::x` and the first
virtual call after a write to it **segfaulted**. On a shape as ordinary as they
come, and nothing in 460 cases had it.

The fix is `Type::shiftBaseOffsets`: the pointer moves every base, not only the
members. It is 8 wide and goes at 0, so member alignment survives the shift.

**The Microsoft vbtable pointer does not go in front, and that had to be
measured separately.** cl lays `N : A, virtual V { int n; }` as A 0, vbptr 8,
n 16, V 24 and `Q : A, virtual V { int q; virtual void h(); }` as vfptr 0, A 8,
**vbptr 16**, q 24, V 32: the vfptr leads, the bases follow, the vbptr comes
after them and before the class's own members. So that slot is now *reserved*
before the members are laid rather than shifted in afterwards - which is also
the only way a `double` member's alignment comes out right, since the padding
before the vbptr makes the delta something other than a multiple of 8.
Whether a class needs one is known from the base-clause alone; the vftable has
to wait for the body.

**And the layout fix made the type_info a lie, which is the other half of the
round.** With A at 8, `__si_class_type_info` - which *means* "one public base,
at offset zero" - describes an object that does not exist, and `catch (A &)` on
a thrown Z read eight bytes early and printed rubbish. That shape needs the
third kind, `__vmi_class_type_info`: flags, a base count, and per base its
`_ZTI` and `(offset << 8) | flags` with `__virtual_mask` 1 and `__public_mask`
2. cxx1 emits it now, and it agrees with clang byte for byte on every shape
checked:

    Z   : A                    flags 0, 1 base   _ZTI1A, 2050    (8 << 8 | 2)
    C   : A, B                 flags 0, 2 bases  _ZTI1A, 2; _ZTI1B, 1026
    M   : A, V                 flags 0, 2 bases  _ZTI1A, 3074; _ZTI1V, 2
    D1  : virtual V            flags 0, 1 base   _ZTI1V, -6141   (-24 << 8 | 3)
    Dia : D1, D2               flags 2, 2 bases  _ZTI2D1, 2; _ZTI2D2, 4098

Three things that record teaches. **A virtual base's number is not where the
base is** - it is where its `vbase_offset` sits in the vtable, negative, and
-24 is exactly the slot `virtualBaseMember` already reads. **The list is the
*direct* bases only**: `bases()` carries a virtual base the class merely
inherits, because the most-derived class lays it down, so Dia's record named
three bases where clang names two - hence `BaseSpec::direct`. And **the flags
are about repetition**: 2 for a diamond, which the walk over the base graph
computes rather than guesses.

Two consequences beyond the case. `throw-multiple-bases-refused` is no longer
refused, so it became `throw-multiple-bases` with an `.expected` - it catches a
two-base class by *either* base, which is exactly what the offsets in the
record decide. And twelve golden files changed, all of them Itanium, all of
them a type_info that was previously absent or `__si`: every record in the
three cases spot-checked is now byte-identical to clang's, where before the
change they were not.

## `<type_traits>`, and four gaps of one family

The header is the C++11 core - `is_integral`, `is_floating_point`, `is_same`,
`is_pointer`, `remove_const`, `remove_reference`, `enable_if`, `conditional`
and their neighbours - and writing it met **four separate limitations**, each
of which is why some part of it is shaped the way it is.

**An explicit specialization could not name a base.**
`template <> struct is_integral<int> : true_type {};` is how every trait is
written, and it was refused with "an explicit specialization is a definition,
and this one has no body" - which it had, four tokens further on. The guard
asked for `{` where `structOrUnionSpecifier` already treats `{` and `:` alike.
Fixed; `final` joins them.

**Three are still open, and each is recorded in the header where it bites:**

- `template <class T, T v>` - a non-type parameter whose type is the parameter
  before it - is refused with "expected a type". That is what
  `integral_constant` is, so it is not there; `true_type` and `false_type` are
  typedefs of `_bool_constant<bool>`, which needs only a `bool`.
- **a typedef naming a template-id, used as a base, resolved at
  instantiation.** `: false_type {}` parses and then fails where the trait is
  *used*, with "'false_type' is not a class". So every base in the header is
  written `_bool_constant<false>` outright. The declaration is fine; it is the
  instantiation that cannot follow the typedef.
- a partial specialization on an **array of unknown bound**, `is_array<T []>`,
  stops with `target: no size for this type yet`. A pattern is a shape and
  needs no size, and it is the same anonymous refusal a template parameter used
  as an array element gives.

**And a fourth, met writing the case beside it:** an out-of-line **constructor
of a class template** is refused by name, so a case that wants one has to use
an ordinary member instead - which is also what keeps clang from emitting only
C2 and making `names.sh` report an emission difference as a mangling one.

**`ostream << long double` did not exist**, which is what `longong.cpp` stopped
on: every arithmetic overload was reachable by a conversion and none better, so
the insertion was ambiguous and the diagnostic listed seven candidates without
naming the missing one. It asks `snprintf` twice rather than guessing once -
`setprecision(400)` is legal and `%Lf` near `LDBL_MAX` is five thousand digits
- so `lib/stdio.h` declares the bounded form C99 added and C++11 requires.

**Measured, and the measurement is the interesting half:** `sizeof(long
double)` is 16 on x86_64-linux and **8** on x86_64-windows and arm64-darwin. On
two of the three targets it *is* a double and cxx1 was already right; only
Linux carries the eleven extra digits, and cxx1 already agreed with g++ there.
So the feature was one missing overload rather than a type-system rung.

## Compiler++ links on Windows: clang is the assembler

**`ml64` has no COMDAT directive**, so every mergeable definition - a vtable, an
inline member, a template's - is exported by each translation unit that needs
one. Building Compiler++'s sixteen sources gave **3592 LNK2005 over 518
distinct symbols**: 48 vtables and 470 inline, template and implicit members.

**Two answers were measured and rejected, and the measurements are what to keep:**

- **File-local**, the precedent rung 6.5a set for the throw RTTI. Links and
  runs - the runtime matches a type descriptor by its name string - but vtables
  alone leave the 470 functions standing, and withdrawing everything costs
  `names-vs-cl` 17 cases where cl exports a vtable External, on top of the 51
  already recorded here for the inline functions.
- **A key function**, which is what Itanium uses. Dead by census: of the 48
  colliding classes **43 have none**, every virtual being inline or pure. And
  **cl does not use one either** - measured on this box, it emits the vftable
  External in both objects of a two-file program whose key function is in one.

What was already true and unreachable is that **the GNU spelling links with no
duplicates at all**: clang writes the same COFF and can mark a section COMDAT.
The driver simply never called it - `Driver::link` and `Driver::assembleObjects`
built an `ml64` command whatever `-masm=` said. They ask
`windowsAsmIsGnu()` now.

`cxx1 -masm=gnu` builds Compiler++ into a linked executable whose 129 cases are
byte-identical to the cl build's. The default is unchanged, so an ordinary
Windows compile still uses ml64 and the emit golden read 0 of 735.

## The GNU spelling catches, and the try map that was not there

Three gaps stood between `-masm=gnu` and the exception support MASM has had
since rung 6.5b, and **each was hidden by the one before it**.

`endFunclet` wrote the raw `.L` resume label where every table entry around it
already goes through `labelText`, so the assembler - which discards a `.L` as a
temporary - refused `lea .L.main.caught.0(%rip)`. One call, identity on ELF and
Mach-O.

The **Microsoft throw-info chain** had no GNU twin: `??_R0`, `_CT`, `_CTA` and
`_TI` were emitted only by `MasmCodeGen`, so anything that threw assembled and
failed at link on `_TI`.

**And under those, the one that mattered: there was no try map.**
`emitCoffCleanupTables` was the only FH3 emitter here, so a frame that *catches*
was described as a frame that only cleans up - `nTryBlocks` 0, no handler map -
and a `try`/`catch` linked, ran, **caught nothing and printed nothing**. It also
wrote `.long @IMGREL` with no symbol for a state with no funclet, which the
assembler took as a reference to a symbol named `?`. `emitCoffTryTables` is the
GNU twin of the MASM try emitter, and the dispatch asks
`msTries()[0].isCleanup` in the same words `MasmCodeGen` does.

**The Windows cases read 235 / 0 through both spellings now**, where the GNU one
read 228 / 235. That is what would let `-masm=gnu` become the default, and it is
a decision rather than a tidy-up: flipping it moves all 235 golden files and
re-bases `names-vs-cl`, both of which run the default syntax.

## What is left, at the close of 2026-09-11

**This activity is closed at the user's instruction**, with no further defect
to be resolved in it, so what remains is written down rather than carried:
`docs/HANDOVER-2026-09-11.md`. It holds the seven programs in `tests/open`, the
three groups the 19 `.notarget`, 74 `.nocl` and 132 `.nonames` markers add up
to - Windows exceptions, the Microsoft RTTI for a base away from offset 0, and
the Itanium VTT - and two lessons worth more than any of them: a golden that
does not move proves nothing about coverage, and a subagent's numbers are
re-measured outside its own tree or not believed.

## Virtual inheritance proper: the Itanium group, its thunks and the VTT

**Until 2026-09-15 a virtual base was layout only.** A class with one got a
vtable holding the `vbase_offset` and its type_info and nothing else: no slot
for a function overriding the base's, no secondary table for the base
subobject, no VTT, no `_ZTv` thunk, no deleting destructor - so a call through
the virtual base reached the base's function and `delete` through it freed the
wrong address. Fable's third review (VM6747/TMS6747-REVIEW.md, T9) proved it
with cl6x's own tables, and `tests/open` held it as virtual-base-dispatch,
virtual-base-second-base and virtual-dtor-through-virtual-base. All three are
in tests/cases now, with three more beside them.

**What is written, all of it in `src/parser/ParserVtable.cpp`**, and every
word of it checked against clang's `-fdump-vtable-layouts` and its `_ZTV`,
`_ZTT`, `_ZTC` symbols on x86_64 (scratchpad/ti/t9/tables.py diffs the two
listings) and against cl6x's on the C6000 (the review's layout.cpp and
mangle.cpp probes: every table identical, the VTT addends included):

  - **A virtual base is recorded before the class body is read** - at no
    offset, placed once the non-virtual part is measured (`Type::setBaseOffset`)
    - so that `declareMember` and `registerDestructor` see an override of its
    functions. Such an override takes a **new slot** in this class's primary
    table, as an override of any base off the primary chain does; the
    destructor likewise. The search runs over every base now, `bases()[0]`
    included, which the old `bi = 1` skipped when the primary was not written
    first.
  - **The group.** `_ZTV` is one symbol: the primary table, a secondary table
    for every non-primary base at any depth (`layoutSecondaryVtables`
    recurses through a primary base to its own non-primary ones, where the old
    code stopped at the direct bases), and one for every virtual base with a
    vptr in inheritance-graph preorder (`layoutVirtualBaseVtables`). A
    virtual base's table opens with **vcall offsets**, one per function in
    clang's AddVCallOffsets order - the primary chain's, the class's own new
    ones, its non-primary bases' - the last declared lowest; a destructor
    counts once and its D0 shares the entry. Then the vbase offsets: **the
    primary base's components first, then this class's in preorder**, laid
    down reversed - `Y : virtual V2, A` with `A : virtual V1` has V1 at -24
    and V2 at -32, which `itaniumVbaseOffsetSlot` now answers for every
    reader (the member walk, `convert`, the type_info's flags word) from the
    one list. Then offset-to-top, the *group's* type_info, and the slots.
  - **The final overrider** of a base's slot, [class.virtual]/2: of the
    subobjects of the group's class that contain the target subobject and
    declare an override (`declaredSlot` - the class's own declaration, not
    an inherited one), the one no other contains; none means the base's own
    entry, two means the program is ill-formed and says so. Where it sits
    elsewhere than the table's subobject, a thunk: `_ZThn<n>_` when the
    step is a constant, and `_ZTv<nv>_n<N>_` when the path from the
    overrider to the target crosses a virtual base - `this` moves by the
    fixed part to the virtual base whose table holds the vcall offset at
    `-N`, then by what it reads there. `_ZTv0_n24_N2VD1fEv` and
    `_ZTv0_n32_N2VDD1Ev` on the hosts, `n12`/`n16` on the C6000. Both
    thunks are emitted once per name; a construction vtable names them again.
  - **Construction vtables and the VTT.** A class with virtual bases gets
    `_ZTT<cls>` - [2.6.2]'s order: the primary pointer, a sub-VTT per direct
    non-virtual base that has virtual bases, the secondary virtual pointers
    (every base with virtual bases or reached through one, the non-virtual
    primary bases excepted, in preorder), and the virtual VTTs. A sub-VTT
    points into `_ZTC<layout><offset>_<base>`: the base's group as if it were
    the complete object, with the layout class's virtual-base offsets and the
    base's own type_info. cl6x spells that group as one symbol per table
    (`_ZTV2V5__2V7`, `_ZTV2V1__2V5__2V7`) where clang and cxx1 write one
    `_ZTC` holding both; the words and the VTT's addends are the same, and
    the name is internal to the unit that writes the VTT.
  - **C2 and D2 take the VTT** as their second parameter (`vttSlot_`, the
    way `msVbInitSlot_` carries cl's flag), and every caller hands one over:
    C1 and D1 pass `_ZTT<cls>`, a base call passes `vtt + subVtt[base]`, a
    virtual base's C2 gets the virtual VTT. `itaniumVptrStores` then walks
    every vptr in the object as clang's getVTablePointers does: its own from
    `vtt[0]`, one below a virtual base from the VTT through the vbase offset
    just stored, every other from the class's own group - the same in every
    object the class is part of, which is why those need no construction
    table. The ordinary vtable group is emitted at class completion, so the
    VTT exists before any constructor body wants it.
  - **Two orders that differ**, both clang's: the *layout* of virtual bases
    is the graph's preorder (`Gather` in ParserType.cpp), each contributing
    its non-virtual part only - `D : virtual W`, `W : virtual V` lays W at 16
    and V at 32, where laying W by its full size put V at 48 and copied
    W's `v` in twice; the *construction* is [class.base.init]/10's, a base's
    own virtual bases before it (`virtualBaseCalls`), V before W, which is why
    W's constructor reads a 0 rather than the stack.
  - **Two reads that went by a constant**: a virtual base's member named
    inside a member function with no object written (`v` for `this->v`) went
    through `thisMember` at the class's own offset; and a virtual call to a
    function of a base off the primary chain (`c.g()` where g is a second
    base's and not overridden) found no slot in the class's own table and was
    refused. Both go through the base's own vptr now.

**x86_64-windows refuses a polymorphic virtual base by name** - cl dispatches
through one with vtordisp fields and thunks measured for no class yet - so the
new cases carry a `.notarget` for it; a virtual base with no virtual function
compiles there as before, through the vbtable.

**Measured, not run.** TI's tools assemble and link every case and the emulator
runs them all identically on the three machines, but the C6747 itself is
still not on the desk; what "byte compatible" means here is that cl6x's tables
and ours are the same words.

## Comments in src/ are at most three lines, and now there is an oracle

**The rule, as instructed on 2026-09-11 and enforced from that day:** no
comment group in `src/` runs longer than three lines, and a group standing in
front of a *single* line of code runs one line only - a one-liner gets a
one-liner. `tools/comment-lines` is the oracle, `make comments` names every
breach, and `make test` counts them.

**Why the oracle matters more than the rule.** This section used to carry the
rule as prose. It was applied by hand on 2026-09-02, the tree grew to 400
breaches by 2026-09-08, and the sentence had to be rewritten to admit that a
reader who believed it would have been misled. That is the tree's own rule 5 -
a claim with no oracle is not allowed to be believed - failing on this file.
The rule is the same as it was; what is new is that it cannot rot silently.

**The sweep, 2026-09-11: 770 groups, about 3,000 comment lines out of `src/`.**
It kept whole sentences front to back, because the house style puts the finding
in the first one, and never cut inside a sentence - a first pass that did turned
"spill its register arguments into" into "spill its register", which is a
different and false claim. Two things it had to be taught: a banner
(`// ----- new and delete`) is not prose and must not be reflowed into the
paragraph beneath it, and a sentence that will not fit its cap is better as one
long line than as a mangled short one. Thirty-eight of those were then
rewritten by hand; forty comment lines still run past 100 columns, which the
policy permits - it counts lines - and which is the honest residue.

**Where the dropped text went.** Into this file for the rounds that mattered,
into `docs/` for the rest, and into git history for everything: the tree is
committed, so `git log -p` is the long form. What stays beside the code is the
sentence a reader needs *at that line*.

So when a new fault is mended: write the one line, or the three, beside the
fix, and put the story in the section of this file that owns the subject. A
comment that wants a fourth line is a sign the story belongs here instead -
and `make comments` will say so either way.

## The register's last five, 2026-09-17

**`tests/open` held five programs at the close of the virtual-inheritance
round, all front-end or exception work, and all five closed in one sitting.**
Each is in `tests/cases` now with its `.expected`; the register holds one
entry, found while closing them. Smallest first, which was the order asked:

**A mem-initialiser naming a template-id base** - `D(int x) : P<int>(x) {}`.
The list read its entry with `expectIdent` and stopped at the `<` with
"expected '('". The base-clause had already solved the same problem
("Read the base as a type rather than as a name", `specifiers()` behind
`atTypeName()`), so the list now takes that path when a name - qualified or
not - is followed by `<`, and matches the base by its unqualified type. A
member is never spelt with a `<`, so nothing else changes. Qualified, virtual
and out-of-order template-id bases all agree with clang; a template-id that
is not a base is still refused as neither member nor base.

**Class-scope names inside a lambda.** `[]() { return k + (int)E; }` in
`S::f()`, `k` a static member and `E` an enumerator, was "'k' was not
declared": the body is replayed as the closure's call operator, and
`currentClass_` is then the closure, which declares none of it. `closureOuter_`
already mapped a closure to the class it captured `this` from - but only when
it did. `closureScope_` records the class every closure was written in, a
lambda inside a lambda inheriting the outer one's, and `lambdaScope()` is
asked after the closure by the four lookups that mean class scope: statics,
static member calls by bare name, enumerators (`findClassEnum`) and typedefs
and nested classes (`findTypedef`). A lambda outside any class still finds
nothing. `enclosing()` was not used for this on purpose: Mangle.cpp reads it,
and a closure's name must not change.

**A by-value catch whose copy throws, and a test that was measuring the wrong
copy.** [except.handle]/3 says the copy-initialisation of the exception
declaration exiting by a throw calls `std::terminate`. The fix is one block:
the copy-constructor call is wrapped in a `Block` marked `setUnwindCleanup()`,
which is exactly the terminate scope an unwinding pad gets (the Walker opens a
region around it, the Itanium targets get a catch-all row whose pad calls
`std::terminate`, the C6000 gets cl6x's catch-and-terminate scope). Written,
built, and the register case still printed `outer(9) done` - on the Mac and
on the Linux box, with a call-site table that was right by inspection. gdb on
the box showed `__gxx_personality_v0` entered exactly twice in the whole run,
both for the *first* exception. The `throw 9` had never reached the unwinder
from the catch's copy, because it was thrown from the *throw's* copy:
`throw E(1)` builds a temporary and copies it into the exception object with
`E::E(const E &)`, inside the try body, where the outer `catch (int)` is the
right answer. clang elides that copy ([class.copy]/31) and reaches the catch
copy; cxx1 does not elide it. The program therefore depended on elision, which
`tests/open/README` forbids, and it was rewritten: `static E g(1); throw g;`
is nobody's to elide, and the copy constructor counts generations and throws
on the second - the catch's. Both compilers now stop at `copy2 ` with exit 134,
the unfixed compiler prints `outer(9) done`, and the C6000 emulator agrees.
x86_64-windows is excused by name, its tables marking no funclet as
terminating (dtor-throws-unwinding says the same). **Two things to carry:**
`cxx1` copies a thrown temporary where every other compiler constructs the
exception object in place - legal, one copy constructor call dearer, and a
difference a constructor trace will show; and a register program is a
measurement only if the thing it measures is the only thing that can differ.

**A lambda's `return` inside a `try`.** `deduceLambdaReturn` looked for the
first `return` at the body's own brace level, parsed the statements before it
for their declarations, and read that one expression; a `try`/`catch` put the
`return` one level down, the lambda deduced `void`, and its own `return` was
then refused against it. The deducer reads the whole body now, with
`deducingReturn_` pointing at the answer: the return statement, seeing it,
records its operand's decayed type - the first one deciding, `return;` being
void - and hands back an empty `Return` instead of converting against a
`returnType_` there is none of. `deducingReturn_` travels in `FunctionState`
and is cleared by `clearFunctionState`, so a replayed body never sees an
enclosing deduction's. **Two consequences of reading the whole body, both
handled.** Its string literals were registered in the program and left there
unreferenced - `lambda.x86_64-linux.s` gained a phantom `.L.str` - so the
deducer truncates the string table back, unless the reading emitted a
function or a global that might name one. And a nested lambda met while
deducing was declared, numbered `$_N` and *replayed into a dead call
operator*, which the real parse then numbered past: `_ZZ4mainENK3$_7clEi`
where clang wrote `$_6`. A closure met while deducing is now named
`$deduced_N` from a counter of its own and never replayed; the real parse
numbers from where it was, `lambda-nested-capture` lost 46 lines of dead
code, and every closure number in the new case agrees with clang.

**A floating constant expression.** `fold()` answers in `long long` and
returned false at a floating `Num`, so `constexpr double d = 1.5;`, a
`static_assert` over `d` and `int a[(int)e]` were all "not a constant
expression". The floating folder already existed - `foldDouble`, with its two
host-precision flags, storing `const double` globals and static members - so
this is plumbing rather than a new lane: a const floating *local* is stored
the same way (`constantFloatingInitialiser`); a global `constexpr` double is
accepted when `foldDouble` answers; and `fold()` hands a floating operand to
it where an integer comes out - a cast to integer, the six comparisons, `!`,
`&&`, `||` - through `foldFloating`, which folds the flags away. A floating
*result* stays foldDouble's own. A non-constant initialiser and a failing
assertion are refused as before. `static constexpr double` in-class is a
separate, named refusal and the case leaves it out.

**What arrived, and went the same day.** `tests/open/lambda-static-local`: a
static local inside a lambda's body was emitted as `operator().n`, a label no
assembler takes. It was there before this round (reproduced on the stashed
compiler) and the whole-body reading made it visible. Probing its cause found
three faults under one: `uniqueStaticSymbol` named the object after the
function's *bare* name, so a destructor's static was `~S.d`, and S::f, T::f,
a::g, b::g, f(int) and f(double) all made one `f.n` or `g.n` - "symbol
already defined" for any two of them in a file. The symbol is the function's
mangled name and the object's now - `_ZN1S1fEv.n`, `_ZZN1S1fEvENK3$_0clEv.n` -
which every backend already spells (Masm's `$` prefix for a dot, TI's `$`
for it) and which nothing outside the function links against. The register
is empty; the case holds every shape above, with a guarded static that has a
constructor and destructor.

Measured at the close, on the four sandboxes: Mac 496 cases, 1187
emissions, 306 names against clang, 30 overloads; Linux 496 and 1187 under
g++; Windows 461 cases under cl and 190 names agreeing (lambda-class-scope-names
and lambda-static-local carry a `.nocl`, cl hashing its closure names and
spelling a static local its own way); the C6000 emulator 296, and **cl6x from
CCS 7.4 on the Windows box assembling all 296 and linking every one** through
`Emulator/tests/ti.sh` (705 programs across the three compilers, 0 refused).
Thirty-four goldens changed: the terminate scope, the dead closures leaving,
and every case with a static local taking its new symbol.

## The seam with cl: a constructor's RAX and the order of overloaded slots

**Both from the review of 2026-09-17 against cl (`VM6747/CXX1I-REVIEW-2026-09-17.md`,
A1 and A3), and both invisible to anything compiled by cxx1 alone** - which
is why every suite was green while a program half compiled by cl crashed.
`tests/winlink/` is the answer to that: two-half programs, the a-half by
cxx1 and the b-half by cl and then the reverse, linked and run by
`tools/windows/winlink-check.cmd` and compared by verify-three's Windows leg.
A single-file case cannot join this list; the seam is the point.

**A1. On Microsoft a constructor returns `this` in RAX, and cl's callers use
it.** Measured: cl's `NT::NT(int)` ends `mov rax, this$[rsp]`, and its `mk`
returns `new V(4)`'s constructor RAX as it stands - `call ??0V@@QEAA@H@Z` /
`mov tv73[rsp], rax` / `mov rax, tv73[rsp]` / `ret`. cxx1's every non-sret
function ended `mov $0, %rax`, so a cl caller of a cxx1 constructor held a
null. The function end in `X86_64Linux::emit` now reloads the spilled `this`
into RAX after the return label, for every exit, when the ABI is positional
and the symbol is `??0` (a constructor) or `??_G`/`??_E` (a deleting
destructor, which cl also has return `this`; cxx1's already does, by its
`return this`). The plain destructor does not return it and cl's callers do
not read it. Itanium untouched.

**A3. cl groups a class's own overloads of one name at the first one's
vftable slot, latest first.** Measured with `g(int) g(double) h() g(char)
k() k(int) k(double) m()`: cl lays `~ vf g(char) g(double) g(int) h k(double)
k(int) k() m` - the three `g`s together at `g(int)`'s position with `h`
after them though `g(char)` was declared after `h`; and in a derived class,
a new overload of an *inherited* name is not grouped with the base's slot
but with the class's own run (`Der : Base{f(int)}` adding `n() f(double)
f(int) n(int) f(char)` lays `n(int) n() f(char) f(double)` after the base's
part). cxx1 appended in declaration order, so `g(int)` called across the
seam reached `g(double)`. `declareMember` now inserts a new Microsoft
virtual before the first slot of its name within the class's own run
(`ownSlotsFrom_`, recorded where the primary base's table is copied) and
appends otherwise; every call finds its slot by name and parameters, so
nothing else moved. Both probe tables now match cl's word for word.

Measured on the four sandboxes at the close: Mac 496 / 1187 / 306 / 30, the
tms6747 emissions byte-identical to the golden recorded at 3c1130a (so the
emulator and cl6x answer as before; 138 goldens changed, every one
x86_64-windows, every one a `this` reload or a `.quad` reorder); Linux 496
and 1187 under g++; Windows 465 under cl - the 461 cases and both directions
of both pairs - and 190 names agreeing.

## Build

```
make                 build cxx1.exe with clang++ (Mac) or g++ (Linux)
make test            run the four suites
make clean
```

**`tests/emit.sh --record` keeps what it emitted as a golden, and every later
run diffs against it.** That is the oracle a refactor needs and the suite did not
have: counting what compiled says nothing about what came out, so "this change
emits the same code" was a claim rather than a measurement. Record before the
change, run after it, and the answer is `golden - N of 411 files changed`. It
never fails the run - a changed file may be the point of the change - and it
prints the commit and date the golden was taken at on every run, so a stale one
says so itself. `make golden` is the same thing.

**The golden survives `make clean`, alone among `tests/out-*`.** It is recorded
before a change and read after one, with a rebuild in between, so a clean that
took it away would delete the baseline at the moment it was about to be used.
Remove it by hand or record over it. It is not shipped to the other two boxes
either: `tools/verify-three`'s tar excludes `tests/out-*`, so a run there says
there is no golden, which is the truth - a golden is a *local* before-and-after,
not a fact about the tree.

The assembly is byte-stable across runs - measured, on all three targets - so a
diff of it means what it looks like it means.

**The golden is copied file by file, and it counts itself afterwards.** A plain
`cp -R` of `tests/out-emit` under ~/Documents came back with 411 files and 411
`x 2.s` beside them - the duplicate phenomenon this file records elsewhere - and
the next run read a golden of 822 and reported 411 removed. It caught its own
corruption, which is the behaviour to keep; recording now removes the duplicates
and refuses to record at all if the count does not match what was emitted.

**`tests/corpus.sh` runs the 424 inherited C cases and gates on nothing.** They
came from Compiler-C untriaged, they are C, and this is a C++11 compiler - so
the count is not a pass rate and `tests/c-corpus/README` says what each part of
the failing set actually is. Measured 2026-09-02 on the Mac: 365 ran and agreed,
58 refused, 1 wrong. What it is for is the failing set, diffed across a change.

**Measured again 2026-09-06 at c66c8d0 and unchanged: 365, 58, 1.** That is a
baseline rather than a score, and its not moving is the result. Twelve commits
had landed in between - name lookup reordered, the written destructor's member
walk, lambda capture of a class and an array, eight nested-parse doors behind
one guard, access control routed through two helpers, and dynamic
initialisation touching all three backends - and not one case that agreed now
disagrees, nor one that was refused now compiles to something wrong. The single
`wrong` is the one that was already there.

`tests/run.sh` compiles and runs each case in `tests/cases/` on this machine
and diffs against its `.expected`; a case with a `.error` file instead must
fail to compile with that text in the message. `tests/emit.sh` compiles every
case for all three targets and stops at assembly, so it needs no assembler and
runs anywhere. `tests/overload.sh` is the fourth and works differently - see
"Overload resolution is checked against clang, not against a recorded answer".

```
tools/verify-three            Mac, Linux box and Windows box
tools/verify-three linux      one of them
tools/verify-three windows
```

A change is not done until all three have passed, and this relays the *working
tree* rather than a commit so it can be run before committing - which is the
order that rule wants. Two things it has to do and that are easy to leave out:
`COPYFILE_DISABLE=1` on the tar, or macOS ships an AppleDouble `._Driver.cpp`
that `src\*.cpp` in `msvcuild.cmd` hands to cl; and comparing the Windows
output back on the Mac, because a `.expected` has Unix line endings and a
program's own output leaves through the CRT with Windows ones, so `fc` would
call every case different.

`-MMD -MP` writes header dependencies. Do not remove it: a stale object here
links perfectly and corrupts the heap three passes away, which is exactly what
happened in Compiler-S.
