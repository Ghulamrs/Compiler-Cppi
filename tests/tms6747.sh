# The tms6747 backend, run on the VM6747 emulator against the corpus's own
# expected output: every case in tests/cases that is meant to compile is
# compiled with cxx1i for the C6000, run on vm6747, and its stdout and stderr
# must match tests/cases/<case>.expected, as tests/run.sh requires of the
# host target. The cases that are meant to fail to compile (<case>.error)
# are the front end's and are not run here.
#
# Two lists of cases are skipped by name, each with its reason beside it:
# tests/tms6747-exceptions.txt, the cases that throw or need a landing pad,
# which this target does not unwind yet; and tests/tms6747-lp64.txt, the
# cases whose expected output was written by a 64-bit-long host.
