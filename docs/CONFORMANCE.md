# Where cxx1 and C++11 disagree

Everything on this page is a place cxx1 accepts or produces something the
standard does not ask for. It exists so that a gap is a recorded decision
rather than a surprise found later by a program that relied on it.

A feature that is simply not written yet is **not** on this page — it is on
the ladder in `CLAUDE.md`, and it is refused by name when a program reaches
for it. This page is only for things that compile and are wrong, or compile
and are right by accident.

## An enumeration has its own name but not its own value set

**The half that is fixed is the ABI.** `enum Colour { Red, Green, Blue };`
makes `Colour` a distinct `Type` carrying its qualified name, and the manglers
spell it — measured against clang, four shapes on both ABIs:

```
void a(Colour)               _Z1a6Colour              ?a@@YAXW4Colour@@@Z
void b(cc::BinaryOp)         _Z1bN2cc8BinaryOpE       ?b@@YAXW4BinaryOp@cc@@@Z
void d(Colour, Colour)       _Z1d6ColourS_            ?d@@YAXW4Colour@@0@Z
```

Before that, every one of them came out `i` and `H`, so no cxx1 object naming
an enumeration could link against one from another compiler. It is also what
made a file-by-file differential against a clang build possible at all.

**The half that is missing is the checking.** Underneath it is still
`Kind::Int`, so every conversion path sees an integer:

```cpp
enum Colour { Red, Green, Blue };
int n = 1;
Colour c = n;        // cxx1 accepts. C++ requires a cast.
c = 47;              // cxx1 accepts. C++ does not.
int m = Green;       // both accept: an enum converts to int
sizeof(Colour)       // 4 here; implementation-defined but need not be int's size
```

So a program that treats an enumeration as a small set of named integers
compiles, links and behaves correctly, and its symbols are right. A program
that relies on the compiler *refusing* a wrong assignment still gets no help.

Finishing it means a `Kind::Enum` carrying its enumerators, a conversion rule
in both directions, and overload resolution ranking those conversions. That was
held back deliberately rather than done half-way under time pressure: the ABI
was what blocked a differential build, and opening the type system is its own
round with its own risk to the suite.

## `wchar_t` is not a distinct type

It names the target's underlying integer - `int` on Linux and Darwin,
`unsigned short` on Windows - where the standard makes it a type of its own
that merely has the same width and signedness. So an overload on `wchar_t`
will not be distinguishable from one on `int` when overloading arrives, and
`sizeof` and the arithmetic are right meanwhile. The same trade as the
enumeration above, for the same reason: a distinct type needs a `Kind`, and
opening the type system for one of these should open it for both.

## A parameter's top-level const is dropped from a Microsoft name

```cpp
void f(char * const);      // cl writes ?f@@YAXQEAD@Z, cxx1 writes ?f@@YAXPEAD@Z
```

The standard says top-level const on a parameter is not part of the function's
type - `void f(char *)` and `void f(char * const)` declare one function - and
cxx1 strips it before the type is built, so the mangler cannot see it. The
Microsoft ABI encodes it anyway, with `Q` where there would be a `P`. Itanium
drops it and agrees with us.

What it costs: a function declared that way, compiled by cl in one object and
by cxx1 in another, will not link to itself. Nothing else. Keeping it would
mean carrying the parameter type twice - once as declared and once as the
function's type - and that is not worth doing for a name.

## A static local keeps its own name in the object file

A `static` variable inside a function becomes a global here, named
`<the function's mangled symbol>.variable` - `_ZN1S1fEv.n`, `main.n`, and
`_ZN1S1gEv.l.guard` for a guarded one - where Itanium names it
`_ZZN1S1fEvE1n` with `_ZGVZN1S1fEvE1n`, and cl `?n@?1??f@S@@QEAAHXZ@4HA`.
All are internal to the object and nothing outside can reach any of them, so
this shows up only in a symbol listing side by side with clang's or cl's.
Until 2026-09-17 the owner was the function's *bare* name, `f.n`, so S::f,
T::f, f(int) and f(double) collided in one file and a destructor's static
was `~S.d`, which no assembler takes; the mangled symbol is unique.

## A `void *` converts to any object pointer on its own

```cpp
void *raw = malloc(4);
int *p = raw;        // cxx1 accepts. C++ requires a cast; C does not.
```

This is C's rule, inherited from Compiler-C along with the parser, and it is
what lets the untriaged C corpus reach `malloc` without a cast. It is the one
direction that is wrong: `int *` to `void *` is legal in both languages.

The const hole in it *is* closed - `const int *` will not convert to `void *`,
only to `const void *` - because that route would have undone the whole of the
const work in one line.

## A class name cannot be hidden by an object of the same name

```cpp
struct stat { int x; };
int stat;            // legal C++ - the object hides the class name
struct stat s;       // and the elaborated form still reaches the class
```

cxx1 registers a class or enum tag as a type name in the one table it has for
type names, so the declaration of `stat` as an object collides with it. This is
the C compatibility rule, it exists for headers written before C++ did, and no
program here wants it. It costs a second lookup table to fix.

## Eliding a copy is allowed, and the two oracles disagree about when

C++11 permits a compiler to elide a copy constructor and does not require it,
and the two oracles take different options at their lowest optimisation
setting: clang elides at `-O0`, cl does not at `/O0`.

```cpp
Counted giveCounted() { Counted c; return c; }
Counted r = giveCounted();      // clang: one construction. cl: a copy as well.
```

cxx1 elides, which is clang's answer, in three places: a declaration
initialised by a call that already returns the class through a hidden pointer,
such a call passed straight in as a by-value argument, and a local returned by
value - which is not destroyed on the way out, because the caller destroys it
where it lands.

That third one is not only a choice about how many constructors run. Copying
the bytes out *without* eliding the destruction would destroy the same object
twice, once in the callee and once in the caller.

**And one place cxx1 does not elide where clang does**: a class-typed member
with its own initialiser.

```cpp
struct E { M m = M(2); };       // clang: one construction, built into the member
                                // cxx1:  the temporary, then the copy, then ~M
```

Both are C++11 - [class.copy]/31 permits the elision and does not require it -
and the difference is visible only through a copy constructor that does
something. It reaches the symbol table too, which is why
`tests/cases/member-init-class.nonames` exists: cxx1 emits `M`'s copy
constructor and clang, having elided the call, never needs it.

**And here the two oracles agree with each other**, which they do not on the
return above: measured on the Windows box, cl elides this one as well and does
not emit the copy constructor either - `member-init-class.nocl` records it. So
cxx1 is alone in making the copy, and the case counts live objects rather than
constructions precisely so that all three can be compared at all.

So a program that *counts* constructor calls has no single right answer here,
and `tests/cases/by-value.cpp` deliberately does not count them.
`member-init-class.cpp` counts *live objects* instead, which is 0 either way.

## Three const declarations cl accepts and this refuses

`const A a;` for a plain struct, `const A arr[2];`, and the same at file scope
are ill-formed by [dcl.init]/7 as clang and g++ both read it - CWG 253 - and are
accepted by cl 19.44 at `/std:c++14 /permissive-`. cxx1 refuses them, so a
program written against MSVC alone can meet a refusal here.

The three of them are the only shapes of fifteen measured where the oracles
disagree; cl refuses `const int n;` and the mixed cases exactly as the other two
do. **This is a language question, not an ABI one**, which is why the two that
agree win: cl is the authority on the Microsoft ABI and no authority on what C++
means. `tests/cases/const-uninitialised.cpp` and its `-ok` neighbour pin both
sides of the line.

## A `const` member does not make the special members deleted

```cpp
struct Holder { int i; const int k; };
Holder a;            // cxx1 accepts. C++ deletes the default constructor:
                     // k has no initialiser and never could get one.
Holder b;
b = a;               // cxx1 accepts, and copies k's bytes. C++ deletes the
                     // copy assignment, because k cannot be assigned to.
```

The copy assignment half is handled as far as the compiler's own work goes:
where a class has a `const` member, no implicit copy assignment is *declared*,
which is this compiler's way of saying the standard's "deleted". What is left
is the older rule underneath it - a struct has always been assignable here,
inherited from Compiler-C along with the parser, and that assignment copies
every byte including the const member's.

So the diagnosis is missing rather than the semantics wrong: the bytes that
move are the bytes clang would have moved if the program had been legal.
Refusing it means refusing struct assignment for a case C refuses too, which
is a change to the C path and to a 424-case corpus that has not been triaged
for it - so it is recorded here rather than done in passing.

## A failed `new` terminates rather than throwing

`new` here calls the platform's own `operator new`, which throws `std::bad_alloc`
when it cannot allocate. cxx1 has no exceptions until rung 6, so nothing catches
it and the program terminates.

That is not a compiler this page can excuse into correctness, and it is also not
a thing to fix twice: an allocation that cannot fail is the only one this
compiler can currently promise, and the honest fix arrives with exceptions
rather than before them. The alternative - calling the `nothrow` operator and
answering a null pointer - would make `new` mean something the standard does not
say, in a program that could then be compiled by clang and mean the other thing.

Worth knowing because it decides what a program may rely on: `new` here either
returns memory or ends the program. It never returns null.

## Vague linkage: done for functions, still open for the two forms

A member function defined inside its class is *implicitly inline*, and an
inline function - or a template instantiation - may be defined in several
translation units, so the linker has to fold the copies rather than reject
them:

```
.weak    _ZN7CounterC2Ev              # Linux
.weak_def_can_be_hidden __ZN7CounterC1Ev   # Darwin
```

**cxx1 emits that now**, for inline members, for function-template
specializations and for members defined outside a class template. It did not
for the last two until 2026-09-08: `instantiatePending` replayed those bodies
through a door that did not set the inline flag, so a header defining a
function template failed to link the moment two translation units used it -
`duplicate symbol 'int tmax<int>(int, int)'`. Nothing in this tree caught it
because the suite compiles one translation unit at a time.

There is a second half to it on Linux: for an inline constructor clang emits
only `C2` and no `C1` at all, where the out-of-line case emits both. cxx1 emits
both in either case, which is why `tests/cases/inline-body` is compared for
Darwin and Windows and skipped for Linux - Darwin's spelling keeps `.globl`
beside the weak marker and so still agrees name for name.

**A destructor loses a form the same way, and one of the two is in the
vtable.** Measured over `tests/cases/virtual-inline`, where every special
member is written inside its class: clang emits `D2` and `D0` and no `D1`
anywhere, and puts `D2` in the complete-object slot; cxx1 emits all three of
Itanium's forms and puts `D1` in that slot.

```
.quad _ZN6AnimalD2Ev      # clang
.quad _ZN6AnimalD1Ev      # cxx1
```

Nothing behaves differently for it. `D1` and `D2` are the same code for a class
with no virtual base, which is why clang is free to emit one and name it twice
over - the disagreement is in the symbol table and nowhere else. It is recorded
in `tests/cases/virtual-inline.nonames` as the reason that case skips the Linux
name comparison.

**The special members the compiler writes are inline in exactly this sense**,
so they carry both halves of it. clang marks an implicit default, copy or
assignment `.weak` on Linux and `.weak_def_can_be_hidden` on Darwin, and cxx1
emits a strong global. And clang emits only the constructor *forms* a use asks
for, where cxx1 emits C1 and C2 for every constructor - so a class that is only
ever built as a base gets a `C2` from clang and a `C1` and a `C2` from cxx1.
`tests/cases/implicit-special` is compared for Windows, where there is one name
per constructor and the lists agree exactly, and skipped for the two Itanium
targets with that reason on the line.

Emitting only the used form is not the fix. cxx1 knows which form an *implicit*
constructor was called by - that is the same `used` flag that decides whether
it gets a body at all - but a written constructor would still emit both, and a
compiler with two rules for that is worse than one with a recorded divergence.

Fixing it is backend work in three places - `.weak` in the GNU spelling,
`.weak_def_can_be_hidden` on Darwin, a COMDAT section on Windows - plus knowing
at emission time that a function came from inside a class. Recorded rather than
half-done, because a program built the way this compiler is used today, one
translation unit at a time, cannot see it.


## A `[=]` closure can be larger than it needs to be

[expr.prim.lambda] captures only the entities a lambda *odr-uses*. cxx1 finds
them by scanning the body's tokens for identifiers that name a local of the
enclosing function, which is a scan and not a parse - so a name that appears
without being read, or one the body goes on to shadow with its own declaration
or with a parameter, is captured all the same.

```cpp
int k = 5, unused = 99;
auto f = [=](int a) { return a + k; };   // cxx1 copies `unused` too
```

What that costs is object size and a copy nobody reads. It cannot change what
the program means: a name the body declares shadows the member, because a local
is looked up before a member, and a parameter does the same.

The direction is deliberate. Over-capturing costs a copy; under-capturing fails
to compile a program that should, and the two are not equally bad. A class with
a copy constructor that has side effects is the one case where the difference is
observable, and it is the reason this is written down rather than left implicit.


## A `using namespace` hides an outer name instead of competing with it

[basic.lookup.unqual] with a using-directive open is a *merge*: the names a
directive brings in are considered as if they had been declared where the
namespace and the using-directive both sit, which is usually the global scope -
so they stand beside whatever is already there, and two equally good candidates
are an ambiguity.

cxx1 searches instead of merging. `qualifyForLookup` tries the enclosing
namespaces innermost-out, then the ones a directive has opened, then the name as
written, and the first that answers wins.

```cpp
int f();
namespace N { int f(); }
using namespace N;
int main() { return f(); }   // clang: ambiguous. cxx1: calls N::f
```

The same shape decides an overload set: where a directive opens a namespace
holding `f(double)` and the global scope holds `f(int)`, cxx1 ranks only the
namespace's, so `f(1)` calls `f(double)` rather than choosing between the two.

What it costs is confined to programs that write one name in two scopes and
then open one of them - and in those, the standard's answer is usually a
diagnostic rather than a different call, so the failure mode is a program that
builds here and does not build elsewhere. Refusing outright would be worse: it
would refuse the ordinary case where nothing is shadowed at all.

Fixing it means candidate sets rather than a first-match search, in the three
places lookup is done - `qualifyForLookup`, `resolveOverload`, and
`resolveOperator`. That is the same change argument-dependent lookup wants,
below, and the two belong in one step.

## Argument-dependent lookup reaches only the operand's own namespace

[basic.lookup.argdep] builds an associated set from an argument's type: its own
namespace, the namespaces of its base classes, of its template arguments, and of
its enclosing classes. cxx1's `lookupKeys` takes the first of those and stops,
and it uses what it finds as a *fallback* - only where ordinary lookup found
nothing - rather than adding the candidates to one set.

```cpp
namespace N { struct B { }; int f(B); }
struct D : N::B { };
int main() { D d; return f(d); }   // clang: calls N::f. cxx1: 'f' not declared
```

This is a refusal rather than a wrong answer, which is why it is separated from
the entry above: a program that needs the wider set is told so. It is here
because the two rules are one piece of work and the narrow version is a
deliberate stopping point, not an oversight.


## A destructor that throws while an exception unwinds terminates

[except.terminate]: an exception leaving a destructor during stack unwinding
calls `std::terminate`. **Done on the Itanium targets and the C6000** since
2026-09-15: the parser marks the blocks that run while an exception unwinds -
a segment's pad, a `try`'s resume block, a handler's end-catch pad, less the
resume call itself, since the Itanium unwinder continues from that call's
own site - and each target's table puts a region over them: a catch-all row
whose pad calls `std::terminate` as clang's `__clang_call_terminate` does, or
on the C6000 cl6x's catch-and-terminate scope. **Not on x86_64-windows**,
whose tables mark no funclet as terminating; `tests/cases/dtor-throws-unwinding`
excuses it by name.

## A `noexcept` function terminates on its own throw, not on a callee's

[except.spec]/9: when an exception escapes a function whose specification does
not allow it, `std::terminate` is called. **Half of that is enforced now.**

**Where the escape is certain at compile time it terminates**, matching clang:
a `throw` written inside a `noexcept` function with no `try` in that function to
catch anything cannot do otherwise, so cxx1 evaluates the operand - its
construction is observable - and calls `abort` where the throw would have been.
No landing pad, no unwind table and no funclet, so it is the same on all three
targets, and nothing that compiled before is refused now.
`tests/cases/noexcept-terminates.cpp`.

**Where the exception arrives from a function this one calls, it terminates
too** - unless the function owns an unwind region already. The pad over the
whole body is built out of the *finished* body rather than around the parse,
and that is what makes it cost nothing: an implicit `try` written around the
parse sets `inTryBody_` before the body is read, and `for (S s; ...)` is
refused under that flag on every target, so wrapping the parse would have
started refusing `noexcept` functions that compile today. Building it
afterwards sets no flag while anything is being read.
`tests/cases/noexcept-terminates-callee.cpp`.

**What is left, and why it is a real limit.** A body that already owns an
unwind region - a destructible local, or a `try` - cannot be wrapped after the
fact. Its cleanup row resumes, the resume finds this frame again, and the
destructor runs for ever:

```
before +9 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 ...
```

Handing over instead of resuming is what `tryChainLabel_` and the
`tryBodySegments_` list are for, and a segment learns its chain when it is
built - so covering those bodies means setting the chain up before the body is
parsed, which is the cost this section declined to pay and still declines.
`functionHasPads_` is the test, and a `noexcept` function holding a
destructible object keeps the behaviour it had.

So the rule is enforced for a `throw` written in the function, and for one
arriving from a callee where the function has nothing to unwind. It is not
enforced where the function has an object to destroy, and not at all on
x86_64-windows, where a handler is a funclet rather than a row.

```cpp
void f() noexcept { throw 1; }
int main() {
    try { f(); }
    catch (int e) { return e; }   // clang: terminate. cxx1: returns 1
    return 0;
}
```

**The compile-time half is complete and exact.** `noexcept(e)` answers the same
as clang everywhere it was measured, and the specification is not part of the
type in C++11 - so no name, no overload set and no signature match differs. The
gap is only in what happens when the promise is broken, which is a run-time
question.

Enforcing it means emitting, for every `noexcept` function, a landing pad that
calls `__cxa_begin_catch` and then `std::terminate` - which is what clang does,
under the name `__clang_call_terminate`. The machinery exists here: cxx1 has
landing pads and `catch (...)` on all three targets. What stops it being a
small change is that wrapping every such function in an implicit `try` inherits
two limits that are written down in CLAUDE.md - a local with a destructor and a
`try` in one function is refused, and on x86_64-windows a handler is a funclet
that cannot `return`. Those would then fire on ordinary `noexcept` functions
that have nothing to do with exceptions, refusing programs that work today.

So the order is: lift those two limits first, then this becomes the small
change it looks like. Recorded rather than half-built, and rather than paid for
with refusals of correct code.

**What it costs meanwhile.** A program that relies on `noexcept` to stop
unwinding - which is a program relying on it to crash - keeps running instead.
Nothing that relies on the *promise* being true is affected, because a program
that keeps its promise cannot tell the difference.

## An un-elided call result is not destroyed when an exception passes through

[class.temporary]/4 destroys a temporary at the end of the full expression it
was made in, and [except.ctor]/1 destroys it during unwinding if the full
expression does not finish. cxx1 does both now for a class temporary and for a
by-value argument copy: each carries a guard flag the cleanup pad reads, so one
region can cover a whole statement and still destroy exactly what exists at the
point the exception left it.

**The object a call returns is the exception, and it is marked unguarded.**
Setting a flag after the call means wrapping the `Call` node, and the two
elision paths find their candidate by `dynamic_cast`-ing to it - so wrapping
would silently turn the elision off, which is a worse trade. In practice
elision routes that object into the slot of whatever consumes it, and those
slots are guarded, so `two(make(7), make(2))` balances. What is left uncovered
is an un-elided result temporary with a throw later in the same full
expression:

```cpp
int f(A a, int n);
f(make(1), boom());     // make(1)'s result leaks if boom() throws
```

It is a leak rather than a wrong answer, and bounded by the frame. Fixing it
means letting a `Call` carry the flag to set on return - a field on the node
and a line in each of the three code generators - and it was deliberately not
folded into the change that guarded the other two, which touched the exception
tables on every target and wanted its own verification.

`tests/cases/temporary-unwind.cpp` pins the four shapes that do balance.

### And on x86_64-windows, a copy made for a call that is never entered

The Microsoft ABI puts the destruction of a by-value class parameter on the
**callee**, where Itanium puts it on the caller. So where an argument's
constructor throws after an earlier argument was already copied into its
parameter, nobody destroys that copy on this target: the caller does not own
it, and the callee is never reached.

```cpp
int two(A p, A q);
two(A(1), A(99));       // A(99)'s constructor throws; A(1)'s copy leaks
```

Measured on the Windows box: `live 1` there against `live 0` on both Itanium
targets and on clang. Telling "the callee was entered" from "it was not" is a
state change at the call instruction itself, and cxx1's cleanup regions are
statement-granular - so this is the one place the guard flag cannot answer.
Clearing the guard after the call over-destroys instead, which was measured
too: the callee's own regions destroy the parameter on the way out, and the
caller's pad then destroys it again.

The shape is named in `temporary-unwind.cpp` and left out of it rather than
skipped, so that the case says the same thing on all three targets.
## Inside a namespace, an unqualified name finds the global one first

[basic.lookup.unqual] searches the nearest enclosing scope first, so inside
`namespace cc` a written `Lexer` should be `cc::Lexer` where one exists, and
only otherwise the global `::Lexer`. `findTypedef` looks in the flat type table
before it tries `qualifyForLookup`, so the global wins.

```cpp
struct Lexer { int k; };
namespace cc {
    struct Lexer { int other; };
    struct Parser { Lexer *p; };   // cxx1: ::Lexer. clang: cc::Lexer
}
```

It makes `::` redundant here rather than wrong - a program that writes
`::Lexer` gets what it asked for - and it is why
`tests/cases/global-scope-qualifier.cpp` writes `cc::Lexer` where it means the
nearer one. Reversing the order changes how every unqualified name inside a
namespace resolves, which wants a round of its own rather than a line in a
change about something else.


## A static local's guard is not released if its constructor throws

[stmt.dcl]/4: if the initialisation of a static local exits by throwing, it is
not complete and is tried again the next time control passes through. The
Itanium ABI says so with `__cxa_guard_abort`, called from a landing pad around
the constructor, and the Microsoft one with `_Init_thread_abort`; clang and cl
both emit that pad. cxx1 emits the guard, the acquire and the release and no
pad: a constructor that throws leaves the guard held, and the next pass
through the declaration blocks in `__cxa_guard_acquire` on the Itanium targets
and in `_Init_thread_header` on Windows. What it needs is a cleanup region
inside the guarded stretch - the machinery a local with a destructor and a
`try` in one function are waiting on.

## A static local's guard on x86_64-windows skips cl's fast path

cl reads a per-thread epoch out of TLS before calling `_Init_thread_header`,
so an initialised static local costs one compare on every later pass. cxx1
calls `_Init_thread_header` on every pass and lets it answer: the function
takes its lock, sees the guard past -1, and returns, so the program behaves
identically and pays a lock where cl pays a compare. The fast path is a TLS
read - `_tls_index`, `gs:[88]`, `_Init_thread_epoch@SECREL32` - which this
compiler has no shape for yet.

## A file-scope reference is bound before main unless its initialiser is `&global`

[basic.start.init]/2 lets a reference whose initialiser is a constant
expression be bound during constant initialisation, which clang does for
`int &r = g;`, `int &r = arr[2];` and `int &r = *&g;` alike - the address goes
into the image and nothing runs. cxx1 draws the line at the first: `&global`
exactly goes into the image, and every other initialiser is bound in the init
function, before main. A program cannot tell the two apart except through the
order of initialisation across translation units: another unit's dynamic
initialiser reading `arr[2]` through `r` before this unit's init function has
run would find the reference unbound here and bound under clang.

## A template's static member is guarded by a flag on x86_64-windows

[basic.start.init]/2 makes the initialisation of a class template's static
data member *unordered*, and every translation unit that instantiates it
defines it. cl and clang both give the construction a COMDAT function of its
own - `??__E?member@?$K@H@@2US@@A@@YAXXZ` - and let the linker keep one. ml64
cannot mark a COMDAT, so cxx1 builds the member from the file's one init
function under a weak flag beside the object, `<symbol>$guard`, which is the
shape both compilers already use on the Itanium targets (`_ZGV` and the
object's name). One more weak object per member; nothing links against it.

## A virtual base's mem-initialiser was ignored — fixed

Found 2026-09-08 while checking what EXCLUSIONS.md still called refused, fixed
the same day. It looked like a bad member-access offset and was not: the
subobject was never written.

[class.base.init]/7 gives every virtual base to the most-derived constructor.
cxx1 split that correctly - C2 skips them, C1 builds them - but C1 only ever
asked for a *default* constructor, so the mem-initialiser list was parsed,
checked, and then dropped:

```cpp
struct B { int n; B(int v) : n(v) {} };
struct L : virtual B { L() : B(7) {} };
L l; l.n;          // clang: 7      cxx1: B() ran instead, or nothing at all
```

Where `B` had a default constructor the wrong one ran; where it had none,
nothing was built and the subobject held whatever the stack did. Silent both
ways. `virtual-base-diamond` did not catch it because its classes carry no
data - it counts constructor calls, and a call was made, just the wrong one.

The arguments are parsed in C2's scope and emitted in C1's body, so **C1's
frame is now laid out to match C2's slot for slot**: arguments before `this`,
which is the order `topLevel` declares them in, and not the order the calling
convention lists them in. The two were already independent - C2 inserts `this`
at the front of its `Param` list having declared it last - and C1 allocating
`this` first put every argument one slot out.

One thing is refused rather than emitted wrong: an argument that needs a
temporary of its own allocates it in C2's frame, and C1 cannot read it there.
`: V(f())` for a class-returning `f` is named and refused;
`: V(v + 10)` over the parameters works. `tests/cases/virtual-base-initialiser.cpp`.
